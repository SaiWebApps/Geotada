"""The tracker dashboard — option B, the owner's ruling (2026-09-03, in chat).

Boxes move by ARITHMETIC only: a story's displayed state is derived from its
machine-verified step rows (a step is `completed` only because `track` re-ran
its test itself), so no agent's word — sprint leader included — can move a box
or a percentage. The page scopes to the NEWEST feature, so dead runs stop
diluting the picture. A sprint leader writes short, attributed NOTES beside
the facts: narrative and warnings, clearly commentary, structurally unable to
touch state.

`track.py` deliberately lives outside the product tree (`.claude/ledger/`), so
it is loaded here by path.
