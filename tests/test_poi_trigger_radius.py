"""Structural guard on the per-POI FOOTPRINT — `trigger_radius` — in `data/{city}/poi-raw.json`
and on the three closed hops that carry it to the planner (Phase 7 S7.4; design §5.6 C7;
W7.2 R1).

`trigger_radius` (int, metres) is how far from the pin a walker is AT the place: the
audio placement rule (src/tour/placement.py, S7.3) puts it on the wire and the phone's one
predicate reads it. The corpus has carried it on every Paris record since the first
upload and NOTHING read it (plan defect 1): the phone drew one 10 m circle for a 140 m
square and a doorway alike. S7.4 carries the field through the loader's two silent hops
and sizes the 177 records still at the uploader's default by PLACE KIND (one table,
`scripts/geocode_pois.py::FOOTPRINT_BY_KIND`), with the marquees and the eleven personas'
stops reviewed by name (`scripts/poi_trigger_radius.py::REVIEWED`, a basis sentence each).

This file checks STRUCTURE and the reviewed precedents, for the reason every sibling
guard records (`tests/test_poi_queues.py`, `tests/test_poi_visit_duration.py`): nobody
in this repo can pace out every square; the kind table plus the named review is the
mechanism for wrong-but-well-formed numbers. The precedents pinned below are the places
the W7.2 panel named in their own words, so a silent re-default of one of them is caught.

ALLOW-LIST MECHANICS: per-city checks loop IN-BODY over the tuple (parametrizing over an
empty tuple skips, and the suite hard-errors on skips). Runs in milliseconds, no database.
