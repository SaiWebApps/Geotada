"""Phase 6 narration tests — point first, closes, plants and threads, two lengths, register.

One narration-hand per file, on the `tests/test_tour_visit_time.py` model: every gating test
cites the design section, the quality-standard rule, the persona line or the panel ruling it
enforces (plan §0.1.1; design §7.5). The W6.2 panel's LOCKED rulings are in
specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign/phase6-ledger.md under "W6.2 … LOCKED RULINGS"
(R1 the point, R2 the close, R3 two lengths, R4 plants, R5 threads, R6 the voice, R7 register,
R8 D7's moment); the before-picture the rulings were made on is
evidence/phase6-narration/w61-before-picture.md.

THE ONE WRITER. Every rule below lives in ``src/tour/authoring.py``'s ``_COMPOSE_SYSTEM`` — the
locked voice — and ships to the provider through ``candidate_compose_request_envelope``; the
tests read the envelope (what the writer is actually told), not a second copy. Every edit to
that prompt changes ``premium_authoring_policy_sha256()`` and is a DECLARED BREAKAGE of the
sealed certification data (plan D6.0; Phase 8 re-seals).
