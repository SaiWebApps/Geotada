    The anchors were first placed at arm's length from the thing they name. Every one of
    the eleven said that is the wrong distance, because you do not look at a cathedral
    front from under it — you walk backwards until it fits. Greta: "To look at that front
    you walk backwards… I was most of the way back across the paving, near the little
    bronze star. Forty-five metres wide puts me almost under the doors, craning at
    stonework two feet from my nose." Sofia: "Size the circle to where people stand to
    look, not to the doorstep."

    THE RULE IS KIND-AWARE, and Phase 8 S8.7 is why. Stated as one sentence: **you stand
    BACK from a place you look at, and you walk INTO a place you move around in.**

    - A place you LOOK AT (`poi_role != "setting"` — a facade, a monument, one face you
      take in from a distance): an outdoor anchor's circle covers at least HALF the
      place's own footprint. This is W7.11's original rule, unchanged, and Notre-Dame's
      45 m circles still fail it.
    - A place you WALK IN (`poi_role == "setting"` — a cemetery, a park, a district):
      an anchor is a DESTINATION inside the place, not a viewpoint of the whole of it.
      Half of Pere Lachaise's 500 m footprint would be a 250 m circle covering most of
      forty-four hectares, and three of them would be one indistinguishable blur — the
      opposite of what an anchor is for. So the rule that bites here is that each
      anchor is a DISTINCT standing position: the circles may not overlap, and none may
      be so small that GPS cannot find it.
    - An INDOOR anchor is exempt from both: it is offered on the screen and tapped,
      because GPS is useless under a roof (W7.2 R4), so its radius decides nothing.
