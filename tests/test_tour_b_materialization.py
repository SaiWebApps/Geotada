"""Step 2.4 — fixed-destination B-materialization (HYBRID) fed to ORDER.

When a tour carries a fixed end B and the routed A→B leg fits the walk budget
(so Step 2.2a does NOT refuse), ``select_route`` must pin a concrete POI as the
LAST ordered stop:

  - SNAP: if a selected (already in-corridor) POI sits within ~150m of B, the
    route's last stop is that real POI.
  - SYNTHESIZE: otherwise a sentinel POI at B's *exact* coordinate is added to
    the selected set and pinned last.

The ``end=None`` paths (open walk + round trip) must be LITERALLY unchanged —
the Step-2.0d ordered-id identity baseline (in test_tour_selection.py) still
guards that, and this module re-asserts the open-walk end and round-trip end
behaviour directly.

These are REAL ``select_route`` runs over synthetic corpora — the cost function
is never mocked. Expectations are derived from the live functions
(haversine_m, default_leg_seconds, walk_budget_seconds) so a test fails only if
the BEHAVIOUR is wrong, never against a hardcoded leg time.

    This is the same worry as before — the destination sentinel carries no beats,
    so any downstream "the route has two POIs, it must be fine" check would read
    a one-story tour as a two-stop tour and ship the thin, single-beat-feeling
    delivery the user complained about. What changed on 2026-08-04 is where that
    worry is now answered.

    It used to be answered by DISCLOSURE: the route was still built, and a YELLOW
    tourability assessment rode along on it to say "this is thin". That outcome is
    no longer reachable at any duration the product offers. A single stop can
    speak at most ``MAX_DWELL_AUDIO_SECONDS`` (270 s) and walking is capped at
    0.40 of the request, so a one-story tour tops out at 0.40 x duration + 270 s
    of active time, while the certification band demands at least 0.90 x
    duration. The two only overlap below about nine minutes.

    So it is now answered by REFUSAL: the plan cannot reach the band, selection
    says so, and no route — padded or otherwise — is produced. Note WHICH refusal.
    The start circle is density RED, but a fixed destination makes the density
    gate defer to the routed checks rather than raise, so what actually stops this
    tour is the certification band. The sentinel's beatlessness is still
    load-bearing, and is exercised on a corpus rich enough to deliver by
    ``test_fixed_end_corridor_rich_route_keeps_multiple_beat_bearing_stops``,
