"""Hermetic routing doubles whose EXACT legs can DIFFER from the estimate.

Every other routing double in this repo — ``_DeterministicRoutingClient``
(tests/test_tour_b_materialization.py) and ``_FakeRoutingClient``
(tests/test_trip_preview_contract.py) — is DEFINED to make the street-routed
number equal the pace-corrected haversine, so the planner's estimate and its exact
legs agree by construction and no test can tell them apart (plan
04-implementation-plan.md, Phase-5 read evidence; measured live at W5.1 (b)1: the
gap runs -187 s to +285 s per leg on real Paris streets and flips sign by
neighbourhood). Editing those doubles in place would silently re-point every suite
that imports them, so this file is the home for a double that diverges on purpose
(Phase 5 S5.4, Extends field).

``DivergentRoutingClient`` answers the planner's TWO questions differently, the way
a stale or differently-costed leg pricing would: ``leg_seconds`` (what selection
prices with) returns the plain estimate; ``route`` / ``route_with_receipt`` (what the
final ``summarise_route`` reads) return ``factor x estimate`` WITH a polyline, so the
transit's ``source == "valhalla"`` and ``routing.leg_walk_seconds`` prefers the exact
number. A certification written on ``walk_seconds`` cannot see the difference; one
written on ``leg_walk_seconds`` can — which is the whole point of the double.
