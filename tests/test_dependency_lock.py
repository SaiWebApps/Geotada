"""The committed dependency lock must resolve against public PyPI only.

The Apple-internal mirror (pypi.apple.com) is unreachable off the corporate
network, so a lock pinned to it breaks every fresh install. Measured
2026-07-30: uv.lock carried 1169 Apple URLs for 36 commits (contaminated in
6805c50c, 2026-07-20) and nobody noticed because the main checkout's .venv
was already populated — a fresh worktree could not sync at all. CLAUDE.md
states this invariant only in prose ("Python Dependency Index"); this test is
the executable guard, so recontamination (e.g. an interrupted `make
sync-apple`, which restores the public lock only at its end) goes RED in
`make test` instead of waiting for the next fresh-clone accident.
