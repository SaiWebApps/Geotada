"""Checks about the TEST SUITE, not the product.

Every other file here asks "does the code work?". This one asks "does the suite
actually measure what its names claim?" — because on 2026-07-31 the answer was
no, in four independent places at once, and the product looked fine the whole
time:

1. Every tour test in the Playwright suite stubbed ``/trips/preview``. Fourteen
   tests named for generating a tour, none of which generated one. Its own
   docstring said why: "the test DB's tier-1 fixture POIs can't produce a tour".
2. ``test_workbench_defaults_to_the_real_tts_provider_not_mock`` passed in 0.03s
   while every Play button in the workbench sent ``provider: 'mock'``. It read
   the dropdown builder; the defect was in the request.
3. ``test_preview_does_not_rate_limit_the_free_mock_provider`` asserted the HOLE
   as if it were a property, so closing the hole broke the test.
4. ``make _test-python`` reported 2382 passing while ``pyproject.toml``'s
   ``--ignore`` list excluded the six shards that measure tour OUTPUT.

One name for all four: **the thing named is not the thing measured.** A missing
test is visibly missing; a lying test occupies the slot, so nobody writes the
real one. That is why these live in ``tests/`` and run in ``make test`` rather
than in ``.claude/``. Agent-facing rules have failed here three times by
measurement — ``guard.sh`` blocked 0 of 70 destructive commands, a
lint-enforcer hook was documented for months and never existed, and CLAUDE.md's
rules were read and violated the same day. A rule only works if something
executes it. These execute.

No regex: function bodies come from ``ast``, and every check asserts it FOUND
its subject before asserting anything about it, so a broken derivation fails
loudly instead of passing vacuously.
