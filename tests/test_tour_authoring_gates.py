"""AC-5 — the anti-hallucination gates on the PERSISTED path (`POST /trips/{id}/compose`).

The cutover (step A3) swapped that endpoint's engine to the per-stop authoring seam.
The seam's finalizer was built for the CERTIFICATION replay, which deliberately runs a
structural-only validator, the trusting offline entailment stub, and no coverage
baseline at all.  Moving the persisted endpoint onto it therefore silently dropped
three gates the whole-tour composer had wired for it (ledger decision D3):

* the REAL faithfulness checker (``get_faithfulness_checker`` -> Haiku entailment),
* the coverage baseline (``claims_realized_by`` on the pre-compose stitch), so a bold
  fusion cannot silently DELETE a fact the stitch voiced,
* the full ``validate_script`` scan — the forbidden-phrase / invented-proper-noun /
  invented-year check over glue, which structural traceability cannot see.

Parity with the pre-cutover endpoint ONLY: no new checks, and the certification replay
keeps its own (unchanged) defaults, which is why the three arrive as injectable
parameters rather than as a new default.

``test_unfaithful_output_is_refused_and_trip_untouched`` is the ledger's pinned gate for
this step, so every clause lives inside that one node id: unwiring ANY of the three in
``src/tour/authoring.py`` or ``src/api/routes/trips.py`` must turn it red.

The endpoint is driven for real (live Paris dev graph, a disposable profile and trip)
because the claim under test is not "the finalizer can refuse" but "the PERSISTED path
refuses AND writes nothing" — a gate that runs after the write would look identical at
the seam and lose the trip.  Every provider boundary is a $0 injected double.

    """AC-6/AC-8 — the pinned gate for this step.

    ``compose.py``'s whole-tour composer ran ``_dedup_composed`` (claim-repeat +
    exact-repeat + same-beat near-dup suppression) over the ASSEMBLED sentence
    stream before verifying it, so a fact voiced at one stop and echoed again at
    a LATER stop never shipped twice. The per-stop seam's shared finalizer,
    ``finalize_certification_composition``, assembles per-stop provider output
    into that identical stream but never called the pass — so the same cross-stop
    echo would ship on every authoring surface that finalizer serves.

    AC-6 names BOTH surfaces, so both are DRIVEN here rather than argued from
    the fact that they share a callee:

    * the persisted ``POST /trips/{id}/compose`` engine — the Block-2 seam it drives,
      ``execute_premium_plan`` + ``finalize_premium_composition``;
    * the ``/trips/preview`` engine — ``premium_tour.finalize_premium_composition``,
      the function ``preview_trip`` reaches through ``finalize_premium_tour``.

    Driving only the first would leave a port that moved the pass UP into
    the persisted path fully green while ``/trips/preview`` still shipped
    the echo — which is exactly the fix AC-6 forbids. The preview clause is what
    pins the pass to the SHARED finalizer.

    The last block pins the composition trace, because suppression and
    attestation pull against each other — and an earlier version of this test got
    that relationship BACKWARDS, which is what produced the defect a judge consult
    later caught. It asserted ``trace.source_sentences == shipped`` and justified it
    as "FinalTourBlueprint requires a trace's cited source sentences to equal the
    stop's FINAL sentences". That is not what the blueprint requires. Read
    ``artifact.py:763-769``: it indexes INTO ``source_sentences`` using
    ``source_sentence_indexes`` and compares THAT to the final stop text. The model
    is built for a SUBSEQUENCE — ``source_sentence_indexes`` is constrained
    monotonic, unique and in-range, one per final sentence.

    So the honest shape, which the finalizer now produces and this test now pins, is:
    ``source_sentences`` = the RAW provider payload, ``source_sentence_indexes`` =
    which of them survived de-dup. Re-grouping the bundle post-dedup instead made the
    finalizer's fail-closed provenance guard a tautology (comparing the deduped
    stream against itself) AND recorded text the provider never sent under
    ``derivation="provider_response"``, while ``response_sha256`` still named the
    untouched body.

    (the coverage check counts shared WORDS, so a paraphrase reads as a deletion).

    A check that fires on ~a fifth of a good tour cannot decide whether to ship it. The
    rule the owner set: a check may BLOCK only when it can NAME the specific thing that
    is wrong; a check that can only say "I don't know" RECORDS. Both of these are in the
    second category until the scored replacement lands (see the run-context addendum:
    per-claim scores with an unsupported SPAN, bands not averages, repair before cut).

    They stay ON, stay on the report, and stay in the logs — this is a demotion from
    blocking to advisory, NOT a removal. ``faithfulness_checked`` still records whether
    the pass ran, so "checked and clean" is still distinguishable from "never checked".

    UNDO: put ``faithfulness_failures`` or ``coverage_failures`` back into ``passed``
    and this goes RED — which is the state that blocked every tour on 2026-08-03.
