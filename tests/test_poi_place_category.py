"""Structural guard on per-POI place categories in `data/{city}/poi-raw.json`.

Data row 6.7 of the redesign (specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign): every
POI carries `place_category`, one value from a CLOSED twelve-word vocabulary,
derived deterministically at $0 by `scripts/poi_place_category.py`. Phase 3's
category-diverse replacement is the consumer — a repair must never offer Greta
a third gallery before 10:30 (design §4.5.5), which only works if the classes
are assigned and the vocabulary cannot silently widen.

Same split as the sibling guards (`tests/test_poi_visit_duration.py`,
`tests/test_poi_opening_hours.py`): the pure derivation is pinned here with
always-on tests; the corpus-wide presence checks run per city on an explicit
allow-list a pass run deliberately extends.
