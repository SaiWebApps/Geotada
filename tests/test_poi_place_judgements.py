"""Structural guard on the per-POI place judgements in `data/{city}/poi-raw.json`.

Three booleans and one sentence say what a place AFFORDS a party — redesign data
row 6.4 (specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign/01-design.md:368):

  `children_can_run`  bool  Children can be loud, fast and free-range here. Nadia:
                            38 of her 55 place-minutes were valuable BECAUSE the
                            kids could run, and the corpus had no channel for it
                            (specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign/
                            03-panel-findings.md:160).
  `sit_and_talk`      bool  Two people can sit somewhere quiet enough to hear each
                            other — Fiona & Dev's two green chairs; the Palais-Royal
                            garden wins their afternoon on seating, enclosure and
                            quiet, "three properties no POI in the corpus carries"
                            (docs/personas/09-couple-who-would-rather-talk.md:34-37,
                            75-78).
  `good_after_dark`   bool  Good to be LEFT STANDING there in the dark — the design
                            §3.1 finish rule. Consumed only in Phase 3; priced now
                            so the data exists.
  `judgement_basis`   str   One sentence arguing all three, judgeable by someone
                            who has never been to the city.

Row 6.4 is the ONLY data row with no external source (01-design.md:375-377) — the
model's verdict is the whole provenance — so review samples these rows at twice the
normal rate (W2.9). This file checks STRUCTURE only: presence, real booleans, a
non-empty basis. None of it is knowledge-based, for the reason its two siblings
(`tests/test_poi_visit_duration.py`, `tests/test_poi_opening_hours.py`) record:
nobody in this repo can adjudicate whether children really run in a particular
square. The basis sentence plus human review is the mechanism for
wrong-but-well-formed verdicts; do not add a test asserting a particular POI's
judgement.

ALLOW-LIST MECHANICS: per-city checks loop IN-BODY over the tuple rather than
`@pytest.mark.parametrize`, because parametrizing over an EMPTY tuple produces a
skip and the suite hard-errors on skips (Phase 1 measured it;
04-implementation-plan.md's S2.5/S2.6 sabotage notes both record it).

Runs in milliseconds with no database.
