"""Internal consistency of the golden fixtures — no database, no provider, no cost.

The two golden fixtures used to pin their expected beats as the per-database UUIDs
Neo4j mints at upload (``randomUUID()``). Those ids are ephemeral: none of them exists
in ``data/paris/beats.json``, whose durable identity is the slug (``beat_id`` in the
corpus file, ``stable_beat_id`` on a ``BeatRef``). That forced ``beat_overlap`` to 0.0
no matter what the engine did, and it is why re-recording fresh UUIDs is laundering
rather than repair.

This module is the cheap guard that the fixtures stay keyed to durable ids and stay
internally coherent. It reads the two source documents the fixtures were hand-composed
from, so "the fixture covers the tour" is checked against the tour, not against the
fixture's own bookkeeping.

Tag inventory parsing is deliberately structural (quoted lines, a bold ``**[...]``
block, ``+``-joined tags, a trailing ``— note`` stripped). No regular expressions: a
pattern written against one document silently returned zero matches on the other.

# in the corpus, so growth is cheap and unpoliced.
