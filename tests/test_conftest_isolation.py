"""Regression test for the Phase 4.5 conftest test-isolation guard.

The Phase 4 incident: a golden test called load_dotenv(override=True) which
mutated NEO4J_URI from the test port (7688) to the dev port (7687). The
conftest's session-scoped driver fixture later instantiated a driver
against the mutated env and ran _wipe() — destroying the dev corpus.

The guard in tests/conftest.py:_assert_test_port() now refuses to wipe
unless NEO4J_URI's port is in _TEST_PORT_ALLOWLIST. These tests verify
that:

1. _wipe() raises RuntimeError when NEO4J_URI points at a non-test port.
2. _wipe() proceeds without raising when NEO4J_URI is on the allowlist.
3. The error message names the offending URI/port and the allowlist file.

Mocks the driver so no actual Cypher runs against any real instance.
