"""Deploy-manifest guard — the public Render service must gate off the workbench.

Defects #1 and #2 (both critical, same root cause): ``render.yaml`` provisions
the public ``ondoway-api`` service but never sets ``WORKBENCH_API_ENABLED=false``.

``src/api/app.py`` mounts the editorial-workbench graph-CRUD routers (graph,
nodes, edges, schema) — an UNAUTHENTICATED create / update / DETACH DELETE
surface over the live Neo4j/Aura graph — whenever ``WORKBENCH_API_ENABLED`` is
not an explicit off value (its default is ``"true"``). The code comment and
``tests/test_api_startup.py`` assert the public deployment sets the flag to
``false`` to disengage that surface, but the manifest that actually provisions
prod does not, so the control is off in production and the destructive write
surface is live on the internet.

This test reads the committed manifest and asserts the gate is set to a value
that ``app._workbench_api_enabled()`` actually treats as OFF. It fails on the
un-fixed manifest (flag absent) and passes once the flag is added.
