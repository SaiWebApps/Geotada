"""Structural guard on the per-POI queue pricing in `data/{city}/poi-raw.json`.

Five fields price the LINE in front of a place — redesign data row 6.5
(specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign/01-design.md:369) and §3.3
(01-design.md:178-184): the queue is a FOURTH kind of time, "priced separately,
by hour and season", belonging to the day rather than to the building, and
"excluded entirely under `wall`" — Camille's 28-minute line is priced, Marcus's
hard-wall day is never promised an unboundable one (§2.3, 01-design.md:106).

  `queue_class`           str   none | short | long | unpredictable (closed).
                                `unpredictable` is the catacombs class: a wait
                                that cannot be bounded.
  `queue_minutes_peak`    int   Minutes of line at the worst normal hour.
  `queue_minutes_offpeak` int   Minutes at a quiet hour; never above the peak.
  `queue_peak_hours`      list  Daily bands the peak applies to, as
                                ["HH:MM","HH:MM"] windows — the exact window
                                grammar `opening_hours` uses. [] = no band is
                                worse than the rest.
  `queue_basis`           str   One sentence arguing class and numbers,
                                judgeable by someone who has never been to the
                                city.

This file checks STRUCTURE only, for the reason every sibling guard records
(`tests/test_poi_visit_duration.py`, `tests/test_poi_opening_hours.py`,
`tests/test_poi_place_judgements.py`): nobody in this repo can adjudicate how
long the real line at a particular door runs. The basis sentence plus human
review — standard rate, with the Louvre, Sainte-Chapelle, the Musée d'Orsay and
every `unpredictable` row spot-checked by name — is the mechanism for
wrong-but-well-formed numbers; do not add a test asserting a particular POI's
real wait.

ALLOW-LIST MECHANICS: per-city checks loop IN-BODY over the tuple rather than
`@pytest.mark.parametrize`, because parametrizing over an EMPTY tuple produces a
skip and the suite hard-errors on skips (Phase 1 measured it; the S2.5/S2.6
sabotage notes both record it).

Runs in milliseconds with no database.
