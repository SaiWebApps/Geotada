"""Track B Step B.4 — the stitcher VOICES walk-past vignettes inside the leg.

Seam locked by the plan (adversarial review m-11): BeatSequence gains the
ADDITIVE ``vignette_beats`` field (leg_idx -> chosen beats); ``generate()``
emits, in the transit stage of a leg with vignettes, one beat-cited sentence
per vignette (the FIRST sentence of its beat — corpus text). validate_script
derives its known-id set from poi_beats + vignette_beats INTERNALLY (its
signature does not change). ``_build_anchor_block`` never sees vignette
beats — they are not POIBeats entries.

Pure — no Neo4j, MockGlueClient only.
