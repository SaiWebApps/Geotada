"""M5 REACH — isochrone membership + ReachVerdict mode mapping. Hermetic.

Extends the density-gate coverage (tests/test_tour_density.py): the gate's
GREEN/YELLOW/RED statuses map to ReachVerdict.mode standard/ambient|redirect/
refuse, and the candidate filter switches from the analytic haversine circle
to the (mocked) Valhalla walking isochrone, radius fallback when degraded.

Fixture math (60 min, the one planning policy since 2026-08-04): the audio
target is 3600 x 1.00 x 0.60 = 2160 s and the walk allocation is 1440 s, so an
hour's tour has to deliver 3240-3960 s of active time. Envelopes are 888.9 m
one-way and 444.4 m round-trip. Every number here used to carry a flat 0.83
factor (1793 s of audio, 738 m / 369 m of envelope) that no longer exists.

    three stories each): it supplies stops and almost no walking, leaving the
    walk allocation free for the one-way endpoint pull to close the route on a
    POI in the far half of the 889 m envelope.

    The tour must also fill the hour BOTH ways round, and a tour is only in band
    if it walks about 1200 s on top of its narration. A background that tight
    cannot supply that on its own, so the far POI is the walking — and the
    isochrone run, which is denied the POI across the river, needs an equally
    far POI it IS allowed to reach. Hence the west-bank twin, inside the box at
