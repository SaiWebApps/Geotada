"""Regression test: every POI listed in any export file must match the
canonical record in `data/{city}/poi-raw.json` for the fields that flow
into Neo4j.

History: an earlier pipeline build silently demoted famous landmarks like
Notre-Dame, Eiffel Tower, and Luxembourg Gardens to importance_tier=1 by
forgetting to copy the canonical tier from poi-raw.json into the export
chunk. The bug was masked by the schema's default of `importance_tier=1`,
which has since been removed (see src/api/models/nodes.py).

This test runs in <100ms with no DB and catches both:
  - Tier mismatches (poi-raw says 5, export says 1)
  - Missing fields (poi-raw says 4, export omits the field entirely)
  - Coordinate drift between poi-raw and exports

    Covers BOTH halves of the write path: each city's canonical `poi-raw.json` — which
    every enrichment pass writes through `dump_pois` — and every `export/*.json` chunk
    the sync propagates into. Guarding only the chunks left the real hole: New York's
    `poi-raw.json` stayed unfaithful after its chunks were fixed, so `poi_trigger_radius`
    (and every other pass) still could not write that city at all.

    The test above guards what the chunks SAY; this one guards that they can still be
    WRITTEN. `scripts/sync_poi_exports.py` writes through `dump_pois`, whose round-trip
    guard (scripts/poi_visit_duration.py) refuses any write that would reformat the
    whole file and bury the real change. So a chunk that is not byte-faithful does not
    merely look untidy — it stops that city's fields from ever reaching Neo4j.

    History, and why this test exists: it used to stop the sync MID-WRITE. A New York
    run wrote frommers-nyc-2024-chunk-01 and -02, then hit chunk-03 — the first of 15
    chunks committed at 1-space indent — and SystemExited, leaving two half-synced
    files in the tree and 32 untouched ones, against a comment in the sync promising
    that "an abort leaves nothing half-synced". The sync now proves faithfulness for
    every pending chunk during PLANNING and aborts before any write; this test keeps
    the tree from drifting back, so no city has to be normalised before it can sync.
