"""Regression tests for three auth hardening defects in src/api/auth/routes.py.

1. The magic-link per-IP limiter trusted the LEFTMOST X-Forwarded-For hop, which
   is attacker-controlled — every spoofed value landed in a fresh bucket, so the
   per-IP cap never fired and one host could email-bomb unlimited addresses
   through the (billed) Resend account.
2. The limiter leaked two permanent dict entries per request on
   attacker-controlled keys — an unauthenticated memory-exhaustion DoS.
3. Refresh tokens were neither recorded, rotated, nor revocable, so a stolen
   token minted access tokens for 14 days with no way to invalidate it short of
   rotating JWT_SECRET_KEY for every user.

Each test is RED without the corresponding fix (see the per-test docstrings for
the undo-test) and GREEN with it.
