"""The magic-link ceiling must stop abuse and NEVER throttle a real person.

CONTEXT. Every rate limiter in this codebase was deleted on 2026-07-31 because
each was keyed on the CLIENT IP, and per-IP throttling punishes the wrong people:
mobile carriers put thousands of subscribers behind a handful of addresses, a
hotel is one address, and the owner's own workbench is one address. He hit
"Too many tour generations" on his third preview of the day.

This one ceiling came back, on two keys that a legitimate person structurally
cannot trip — the TARGET EMAIL and a GLOBAL total — because ``/auth/magic-link/
request`` is unauthenticated and sends a REAL email to whatever address the body
names, and Resend enforces its abuse policy by suspending the account. That
failure takes login away from everybody, including him.

The owner's stated worry when approving it was: *"My concern is that you will end
up throttling me again."* ``test_a_real_person_is_never_throttled`` and
``test_one_caller_mailing_many_addresses_is_not_throttled_per_caller`` are that
worry written as executable checks. If either ever goes red, the ceiling has
regressed into the thing he deleted.
