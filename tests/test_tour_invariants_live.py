"""Live-graph tour INVARIANT gate (marker: invariants; excluded from the bar).

Generates REAL tours across representative start/duration/lens/end paths on the
dev graph (7687) + Valhalla, and asserts the workbench-reported 2026-07 defect
classes stay dead. Each is a bug a real tester hit; a regression flips this RED.

Run as part of ``make test``; its internal shard provisions dev data and Valhalla.

Design notes
------------
- Assertions run on the ENGINE output (``generate`` -> Script + Route), the
  shared core every surface (preview/generate) is built on. Per-stop narration
  is reconstructed by grouping ``script.script`` sentences by ``stop_idx``.
- Every input asserts ALL invariants and collects every violation into one
  message, so a single failing tour reports its full defect list (not just the
  first), the way the mechanical sweep does.
- These are HOLISTIC, real-corpus guards. The fast, deterministic per-fix unit
  guards live in ``test_tour_selection.py`` / ``test_tour_generation.py`` /
  ``test_trip_preview_vignettes.py`` and run in the default bar.

    # workbench built a route that ran ~5 km PAST its own destination to Parc de la
    # Villette and came back. The A->B corridor here is a straight 2.5 km east along the
    # Seine, so a stop in the north-east is not a detour on the way — it is a round trip
    # bolted onto a one-way walk.
    #
    # COORDINATES ARE RESOLVED, NOT TYPED. Rue Royale carries no POI of its own (it is a
    # street), so the start is the midpoint of its two ends as the graph holds them:
    # Place de la Concorde (48.865608, 2.321038) and La Madeleine (48.870202, 2.325391).
    # The end is Notre-Dame Cathedral's exact graph coordinate — the same one 11 archived
    # tours already start from.
    #
    # WHY 300 AND NOT LESS: the engine prices this 2563 m straight line at 4153 s of
    # walking (3 km/h under the x1.35 haversine correction), and a fixed destination must
    # be reachable inside the planning band's maximum elapsed ceiling, which puts the
    # feasibility floor around 63 min at the 1.00 nominal fraction. (Before 2026-08-04
    # the ceiling was the bare walk budget at a flat 0.83 and the floor was 209 min; the
    # helper that computed it, ``smallest_duration_min_for_walk_seconds``, was deleted
    # with the legacy policy.) Below the floor the request is refused outright and the
    # defect cannot reproduce. 300 is the owner's actual request.

#
# W8.6 (2026-08-24) moved both NYC rows out of `_PATHS` because their premise ("a
# feasible fixture must not refuse") was measurably false on the un-enriched
# corpus: lower-manhattan 26 min buildable of a 60 ask (43.3%) and 74 of 150
# (49.3%), greenwich 64 of 150 (42.7%), the generality sweep 122 of 250 (48.8%) —
# every one under the half line the W8.6 panel re-affirmed 11/11 (Q5). It parked
# them under a test asserting the true thing (an honest refusal that names the
# buildable day and carries a way out) and wrote the exit condition into that
# test: "it fails the moment the corpus upload makes either day buildable, sending
# both rows back to `_PATHS`."
#
# 2026-08-25: the enriched corpus landed, both days build (4 stops and 2 stops for
# their 150-minute asks), the alarm fired on both rows, and both rows are back in
# `_PATHS` above with every narrative invariant judged again. Nothing is left for
# the tombstone to hold, and an empty `parametrize` list is a vacuous pass (pytest
# turns it into a skip), so the list and its test are deleted rather than kept as
# an empty shell.
#
# WHAT THAT COSTS, stated rather than hidden: the far-short refusal shape those
# rows exercised ("the longest day that can be built here is about N minutes",
# carrying `alternatives` and `gap_minutes`) now has NO live case among this
# file's pinned starts. Swept 2026-08-25 across every `_GENERALITY_STARTS` entry
# of both cities at 60/120/150/180/250 min: 57 of 60 combinations BUILD, and the
# three surviving refusals are a different shape that this test's assertions do
# not fit — new_york (40.7736, -73.9566) @60 raises `TourabilityRefusedError`
# ("No POIs are reachable on foot within a 60-min walk of this start"), and
# new_york (40.7061, -73.9969) @60 and @150 raise the OVERRUN
# `CertificationPlanningInfeasibleError`; all three carry `alternatives=()` and
# `gap_minutes=None`. Re-pointing the test at those would have meant deleting both
# of its assertions to get green, so it was deleted honestly instead.
#
# WHAT STILL GATES THE CONTRACT, checked rather than assumed: the never-silent
# half is gated here for every start and duration by
# `test_no_silent_empty_tour_in_any_city` below. The refusal-is-useful half keeps
# HERMETIC coverage on planner-raised refusals — non-empty `alternatives` in
# `test_tour_feasibility.py` (`test_far_end_short_budget_raises_with_gap_and_alternatives`),
# `test_tour_dials.py` (`test_composed_dials_cannot_duck_under_the_one_underfill_line`)
# and `test_tour_party.py` (`test_a_leg_cap_that_starves_the_day_refuses_with_the_cap_named`);
# the message naming minutes in the same dials test, in
# `test_tour_selection.py::test_fixed_end_red_start_circle_defers_to_routed_fixed_end_checks`
# and in `test_tour_b_materialization.py` (
# `test_one_story_fixed_end_corpus_is_refused_not_padded_with_a_sentinel`).
# What is gone with this test, and is worth someone's attention rather than a
# silent loss: no test now asserts the two halves TOGETHER over whatever refusal a
# live corpus happens to produce.

_MIN_DWELL_NARRATION_CHARS = 80

# INV8 — no small run of consecutive stops forces an illogical out-and-back
# detour relative to what a direct walk between its own flanking stops costs.
#
# The 2026-08-04 owner-reported defect (Rue Royale -> Notre-Dame, 300 min): the
# workbench built a route that ran ~5 km PAST its own destination, out to Parc
# de la Villette, and back. The first version of this check ("no single leg
# may eat more than 25% of the tour's whole walking budget") MISSED that exact
# case — the ~5 km round trip splits into two legs of roughly 2.5 km each,
# neither one alone crossing a whole-tour budget share — while it flagged 8 of
# the file's other 8 routes (every one of the 9 fixtures in `_PATHS` except
# the defect fixture itself), which are simply long because the tour itself
# covers a lot of ground. Sharing a budget was the wrong shape of check: a
# spread-out route and a there-and-back detour both produce "long legs"; only
# the detour produces a leg PAIR that costs far more than a direct walk
# between the same two neighbours would have.
#
# The SECOND version measured only a single stop against its immediate
# neighbours (leg p->i plus i->n vs. the direct p->n walk). That is blind to a
# CLUSTER: two adjacent far-away stops sit close to EACH OTHER, so each one's
# immediate neighbour is the other far stop, not a near one — the single-stop
# ratio never spikes even though the pair, taken together, is the identical
# commute-shaped detour. This version instead slides a window of 1 to
# ``_MAX_DETOUR_WINDOW`` CONSECUTIVE stops and compares the cost of walking
# through the whole window against the direct walk between whatever sits
# immediately before and after it — catching a lone detour stop and a small
# detour cluster the same way. The window is capped deliberately: a run of
# many consecutive stops is what an ordinary multi-stop tour looks like (it is
# EXPECTED to cost much more than a straight line across itself, because
# visiting things is the point), so growing the window without bound would
# flag good, ordinary tours. A cluster larger than the cap is a real
# possibility this check does not cover — a known, stated limitation, not a
# silent one.
#
# Both a ratio AND an absolute-minutes floor must trip together, so two stops
# that merely sit close together (a tiny, easily-inflated direct distance)
# cannot false-positive on ratio alone.
#
# CALIBRATION (2026-08-04, against this file's own 9 live `_PATHS` fixtures):
# a first pass at a 600s (10 min) floor still flagged 4 routes whose detour
# reaches as high as 1377s (23 min) of real extra walking, at a single stop —
# Luxembourg Gardens, inserted between the Pantheon and the Sorbonne on a
# 3-stop, 120-minute tour, where it is 40% of that tour's ENTIRE walk. That
# is a real, substantial detour by any absolute measure, not "a few hundred
# metres" — it is kept OUT of this check's flagged set on the judgment call
# that a park matching the tour's own requested lens (parks_gardens) is worth
# a real detour, not because its size is negligible. The reported Villette
# defect costs roughly 130 minutes of extra walking at the engine's pace for
# its ~5 km round trip — a full order of magnitude past Luxembourg Gardens.
# 1800s (30 min) draws the line between them; it is an empirical line fit to
# this file's fixtures, not a principled worthiness threshold, and Task 4 may
# need to move it once more real routes exercise this check.
_MAX_STOP_DETOUR_RATIO = 2.0  # via-this-window cost vs. the direct walk around it
_MIN_DETOUR_EXTRA_SECONDS = 1800  # ...and at least 30 real minutes of pure detour
_MAX_DETOUR_WINDOW = 3  # check runs of 1, 2, and 3 consecutive stops as one unit

# ...AND THE DETOUR IS NOT EARNED BY WHAT IS IN IT (Phase 8 W8.6, 2026-08-24).
#
# THE LIMITATION THIS CLOSES IS THE ONE THE COMMENT ABOVE ALREADY NAMED: "a run of
# many consecutive stops is what an ordinary multi-stop tour looks like (it is
# EXPECTED to cost much more than a straight line across itself, because visiting
# things is the point)", and "1800s draws the line ... it is an empirical line fit
# to this file's fixtures, not a principled worthiness threshold, and Task 4 may
# need to move it once more real routes exercise this check."
#
# More real routes have now exercised it, and they show the two-part test firing on
# a GOOD tour. A LOOP's flanking points sit near each other by construction, so its
# windows are compared against a very short direct line and the ratio explodes
# however sensible the day is. Measured on the live concorde-250-loop
# (evidence/phase8-gates/w86-inv8-probe.log): 69 minutes of walking against 130
# minutes of standing — the shape every persona day has (Camille 0.40, Rosemary
# 0.43, Greta 0.55) — and EVERY stop earns its own walk with room to spare, priced
# in the currency the W8.6 panel ruled in (Q2, 11/11):
#
#     Hotel Le Meurice       46s walking / 912s standing   ratio 0.05
#     Palais-Royal          887s walking / 1800s standing  ratio 0.49
#     Arc du Carrousel      194s walking / 600s standing   ratio 0.32
#     Jardin des Tuileries    0s walking / 2400s standing  ratio 0.00
#     Place de la Concorde 1303s walking / 2100s standing  ratio 0.62
#
# against the panel's cap of 2.0. So the third clause asks what the first two
# cannot: is this extra walking EARNED by the time the window gives the visitor?
# It is the same rule `selection.stop_earns_its_walk` applies when ADMITTING a stop
# (design §4.5.1 — price trades in visitor-time), now applied to judging a finished
# route, so the planner and the gate that judges it speak one currency (§10.8.2).
#
# THIS DOES NOT SOFTEN THE DEFECT THE CHECK EXISTS FOR. The reported Villette shape
# spends ~130 minutes of walking to reach places the visitor barely stands at, so
# its extra walking dwarfs its window's dwell and it still fires — as do both
# synthetic true-positive fixtures below, whose stops carry no visit seconds at all
# (a detour to somewhere you spend no time is pure detour by definition). All THREE
# clauses must trip together.

    **BOTH HONEST REFUSAL CLASSES COUNT, re-derived at Phase 8 W8.6 (2026-08-24)
    as a written decision under §0.1.3 — not a catch widened to get green.** The

    has TWO loud refusals, not one: `TourabilityRefusedError` (there is nothing
    to tour here) and `CertificationPlanningInfeasibleError` (the day that can be
    built here is far shorter than the one asked for). The second one's own
    definition records that it was built to be indistinguishable from the first
    at the surface — "the same two fields TourabilityRefusedError carries, so ONE
    refusal-detail helper can serialise both, and a surface never has to know
    which one it caught" — and it carries the same `alternatives` / `gap_minutes`
    the first does. This test caught only the first, so an honest refusal naming
    the buildable day ("the longest day that can be built here is about 122
    minutes, far short of the 250 minutes asked for") was scored as a defect.
    The W8.6 panel ruled 11/11 that exactly this refusal is the CORRECT answer
    below half the ask (Q5) and that its sentence should stay as written. What
    the test forbids is unchanged: a Route with no stops, returned in silence.
