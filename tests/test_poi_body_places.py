"""Structural guard on a city's body places in `data/{city}/body-places.json`.

Body places are the toilets and benches a day is physically built around
(redesign §3.1, specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign/01-design.md:158-161:
body stops are promises — "a rest window with no bench under it is thirteen
minutes standing on a stick"). Nadia's toilet stop is "Ten minutes, zero
cultural content, entirely non-negotiable"
(docs/personas/03-family-with-children.md step 5, lines 22-23); Rosemary's bench
IS a stop with a location and a duration, and she chose her tour partly for a
toilet she knew about (docs/personas/05-step-free-visitor.md steps 3 and 7).

`scripts/poi_body_places.py` collects them from OSM at $0 into a file that is
deliberately SEPARATE from `poi-raw.json`: a body place is not a narrated place
and must never enter the beat pipeline. One record per OSM node:

  `id`        str    "body-toilet-<osmid>" | "body-bench-<osmid>", unique
  `kind`      str    "toilet" | "bench" — nothing else
  `lat`/`lng` float  inside the city's registry bbox
  `poi_role`  str    always "body"

WHAT THIS FILE CHECKS. Every per-city assertion is STRUCTURAL — presence,
vocabulary, bbox, uniqueness — over an allow-list of cities whose pass has run
(the `tests/test_poi_opening_hours.py` pattern, including its in-body loop: the
suite hard-errors on skips, so nothing here parametrizes over a possibly-empty
tuple). The three HOP tests at the bottom guard the road a record travels to the
planner; the ones marked RED stay red until S2.5's planner/upload half lands.
