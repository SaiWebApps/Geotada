"""AC-4 / AC-9 / AC-22 — the AUTHOR block (Block 2) never re-plans a route.

A persisted trip already HAS its route: /trips/{id}/compose must author that exact
route, never re-plan one. There is now exactly ONE seam that does this —
``plan_premium_authoring`` -> ``execute_premium_plan`` -> ``finalize_premium_composition``
in ``src/tour/premium_tour.py``. The second implementation that used to live in
``src/tour/authoring.py`` was deleted on 2026-08-04; these guards moved with the claim.

The four properties the AUTHOR block is defined by (ledger decision D5):

* it never reaches the planner — proven STRUCTURALLY as well as at runtime, because a
  module-level ``from .selection import select_k_routes`` binds at import time and a
  monkeypatch on the ``selection`` module can no longer see it. The structural guard is
  **FUNCTION-SCOPED**: ``premium_tour.py`` as a whole legitimately imports the planner for
  ``plan_premium_tour`` (which is BLOCK 1, and whose job IS to plan), so a module-scope
  check here would be vacuously red forever. Only the four Block-2 function bodies are
  read, and a function-local import inside one of them is exactly the shape that check
  exists to catch;
* it builds exactly ONE authoring unit per dwell stop — not one per sentence, and
  never zero for a stop the stitched script forgot — so a caller's spend precheck
  can reserve ``len(units)`` calls and be right;
* it tolerates what real persisted trips actually contain — a round-trip transit
  shape (``len(transits) == len(pois) + 1``), 1..15 stops, and receiptless
  haversine-degraded legs, all of which ``plan_premium_tour``'s PLANNING bars refuse
  outright. Those bars live in Block 1 and are not part of Block 2 (AC-22).

``test_the_author_block_never_replans`` is the ledger's pinned gate for this step, so it
carries every one of those clauses itself: reverting ANY of them must turn that one node
id red.
