"""Unit tests for route-level claim-repetition suppression (backlog #22).

Fixtures mirror the live Île de la Cité case: three beats from three source books
each narrate the Parisii founding; a fourth (the Nanterre debate) merely mentions
the Parisii and must survive. Only a PURE restatement is dropped — a compound
sentence carrying a novel fact alongside a repeated one is kept whole (the
content-safety property the skeptic panel demanded).
