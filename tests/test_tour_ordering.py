"""ORDER — the visiting-order step, end to end. Hermetic: no DB, no engine run.

Covers all three pieces and the one dispatcher that chooses between them:
``held_karp_open`` (exact, provably optimal, exponential), ``cheapest_insertion_open``
(cheap, mediocre), ``improve_order_or_opt`` (cheap, close to optimal), and
``order_stops``, which every caller uses and which nothing outside this module
may bypass.

PROVE: on the seesaw fixture the exact solver beats greedy nearest-neighbour with
zero direction reversals and honors fixed_end; for every n in 4..8 its cost equals
the itertools.permutations brute-force optimum (open, round-trip, and asymmetric
variants); the cheap path lands within a MEASURED small ratio of that same proven
optimum; and one ordering call stays inside a per-call CPU budget at every n the
corpus can produce.

COST CEILINGS. Measured 2026-08-05, BEFORE any change, so a regression shows up as
a number rather than as a feeling:

    exact solver, n=10    3.6 ms      n=13   46.6 ms
    exact solver, n=16  556.2 ms      n=17    1.27 s

One 120-minute planning request made 495 ordering calls at n up to 17 and spent
191 seconds — 100% of the run — inside this step. That 500x multiplier is why the
budget below is a per-CALL figure and not a user-visible latency figure.
