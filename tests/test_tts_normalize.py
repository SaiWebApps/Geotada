"""Unit tests for TTS pronunciation normalization (backlog #23).

The normalizer runs ONLY on TTS-consumed text (inside the real providers'
``generate``), never on the stored corpus. It rewrites tokens a neural TTS voices
as letters/symbols into the plain English a listener expects to hear:

- regnal / papal Roman numerals: ``Louis XIV`` -> ``Louis the fourteenth``
- initials joined by a hyphen: ``J.-B.`` -> ``J. B.``

Correctness matters less than RESTRAINT: the corpus is a Paris-history text full
of ``World War II``, the pronoun ``I``, ``Chapter IV`` and ``Vatican II`` — none
of which may be touched. A curated regnal-name allow-list gates every rewrite.
