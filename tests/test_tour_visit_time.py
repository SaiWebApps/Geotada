"""How long a visitor spends AT a place — the third hand on the tour clock.

Time at a stop is `min(what the place absorbs, what this visitor's interest
justifies, the party's ceiling)`, floored at the stop's own narration.

WHY ALL THREE ARGUMENTS ARE NEEDED, from `docs/personas/`. The first two are both
MAXIMISING, so neither can express Nadia's *"six minutes is the ceiling here, not
the floor"* (`03-family-with-children.md` step 3) — hence the party ceiling. And a
single per-place number cannot express Camille and Theo giving the same Cour Carree
33 minutes and 8 (`02-dark-history-walker.md`) — hence the interest term.

These tests are hermetic: constructed POIs, a constructed lens graph, no database.
