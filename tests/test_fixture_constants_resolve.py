"""Every path constant that names a fixture must name a file that is there.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. On 2026-09-02 the `specs/` tree was deleted, and nine files
the product OPENS at runtime were living inside it. Five module-level constants
pointed at six of them; the other three are named inside a JSON manifest and
reached through it, which is its own trap and gets its own test at the bottom.
Nothing in the suite would have noticed:

  * `tests/test_tour_text_candidate_runner.py` and
    `tests/test_tour_batch_candidate_runner.py` only IMPORT their module.
    `Path(...) / "x.json"` never touches the disk, and the reads sit inside
    functions those tests do not call.
  * `scripts/coverage_calibrate.py` and `scripts/faithfulness_calibrate.py` are
    imported by no test at all.
  * `make lint` cannot help: the ruff path list in `Makefile` names
    `tour_batch_candidate.py` but not `tour_text_candidate.py`,
    `coverage_calibrate.py` or `faithfulness_calibrate.py`.

So the whole suite would have gone green over a deleted folder, and the failure
would have surfaced weeks later as a `FileNotFoundError` in a paid batch run,
against a file no longer present in any reachable commit.

A constant is only as true as the file under it. This asserts the file, by
reading the constant the product reads — never a path retyped here, which would
pass while the product's own copy pointed somewhere else.
