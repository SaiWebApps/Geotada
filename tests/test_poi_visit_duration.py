"""Structural guard on the per-POI visit capacities in `data/{city}/poi-raw.json`.

Three fields describe how long a visitor usefully spends at a place:

  `typical_duration_min`  int          MINUTES spent at the place WITHOUT going in.
  `visit_seconds_inside`  int | None   SECONDS spent INSIDE. None = no interior
                                       (a street, a bridge, a square).
  `visit_basis`           str          One sentence arguing for the numbers, written
                                       so someone who has never been to the city can
                                       judge them ("interior, ~30 rooms, 45-60 min").

Two numbers exist because one cannot serve two visitors. Camille gives
Sainte-Chapelle 66 minutes including the queue; Theo gives the same building 15
minutes from the outside and never goes in (`docs/personas/01-architecture-pilgrim.md`
steps 16-17, `docs/personas/02-dark-history-walker.md:77`).

WHAT THIS FILE CHECKS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. Every assertion here is
STRUCTURAL — shape, sign, ordering, presence. None is knowledge-based, because the
repo owner cannot check Paris facts and a test nobody can adjudicate is worse than no
test. A plausible-but-wrong "20 minutes" for a specific church passes here by design;
`visit_basis` exists so a human reviewer can catch that class, and nothing automated
can. Do not add a test asserting a particular POI's number.

MIND THE UNITS. The outside number is MINUTES and the inside number is SECONDS.
Comparing them without converting is the mistake this file's second test is written
to make impossible to ship.

WHY THREE OF THESE CAN PASS ON A FILE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN PRICED. The three checks
about `visit_seconds_inside` — ordering, sign, ceiling — are conditional on the
place having an interior at all, because `null` is a legitimate value for a street
or a bridge. On a corpus where nothing has been priced yet they are vacuously true
and report green. That is correct, but it means a partial green here is NOT evidence
the data is partly fine: the two presence checks are what say whether the pass ran.
Read them first.

The tests run in a few milliseconds with no database.
