"""M7 VERIFY — rapidfuzz provenance + faithfulness entailment. Hermetic.

PROVE: a beat whose source_passage is verbatim in its chunk passes; a
fabricated/wrong-chunk passage fails with its score; beats without
provenance are skipped (corpus not backfilled). Faithfulness: a stub that
rejects a claim flags exactly that beat-cited sentence; the Mock default
trusts the corpus.
