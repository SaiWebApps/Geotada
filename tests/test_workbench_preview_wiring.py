"""The workbench preview must send what it means and reject what it cannot honour.

THREE MEASURED DEFECTS (2026-07-19), all of which made "tour preview" look broken
to a human pressing the button:

1. ``city_slug`` was never sent by ``generateTourPreview`` (``frontend/review.html``),
   so ``TripPreviewRequest``'s default of "paris" applied to EVERY preview. A
   London or New York workbench session previewed the PARIS corpus from a
   London/NY start, found nothing reachable, and 422'd.

2. An unknown lens string was silently ignored. ``_lens_relation``
   (``selection.py:2451-2477``) classifies every POI as a "miss" for an
   unrecognised lens, so ``lens_relevance`` returns the uniform ``LENS_FLOOR``
   (0.25). A uniform MULTIPLICATIVE factor leaves relative ranking identical to
   passing no lens, so a typo produced the un-lensed tour with no signal at all.

3. The lens input offered its vocabulary only as a ``placeholder`` — which is not
   a value — so the default request sent NO lenses.

TWO OWNER RULINGS (2026-07-31), both the same principle — the workbench must
replicate the tourist's app experience as closely as possible:

4. ``generateTourPreview`` opened a ``window.confirm`` spend warning before every
   preview. A tourist is never asked to approve spend, so the workbench must not
   ask either. Removed; section 4 below keeps it removed.

5. ``loadTtsProviders`` force-selected the ``mock`` TTS provider after fetching
   the provider list, silently overriding the ``openai`` default. Every workbench
   "play" was therefore a silent WAV that an editor could mistake for real
   narration — the audio twin of the standing never-mock-in-the-workbench rule.

These tests are cheap, hermetic and $0.
