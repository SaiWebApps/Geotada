"""Phase 7 S7.9 (design §5.6 C7 audio; W7.2 R5, 11/11 "background audio is not a feature, the
product"): the phone KEEPS PLAYING pocketed and hears interruptions through ONE door.

What only a file read can assert — the iOS background modes the app declares, the audio
session dependency, the one provider door the interruption events come through and the
session being configured — is asserted here and says so. The BEHAVIOURAL half (pause on a
call, resume at the cut sentence's start inside the footprint, the couple's tap, the missed
close queued off the footprint, ducking changes nothing) lives in
mobile/test/services/session_interruptions_test.dart. Free tier: files only.
