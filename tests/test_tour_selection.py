    Two gates have to clear, and they pull in opposite directions.

    The Phase 6 DENSITY gate wants a rich, tight pool: >= 4 anchor candidates
    with fill >= 1.0 and compactness <= 0.6, or the rich-pool escape of fill
    >= 1.5 with >= 6 anchors. The certification TIME band (0.90-1.10 of the
    request since 2026-08-04, two-sided) wants a pool the planner can spend a
    whole hour on. The old fixture — 4 POIs colocated within ~7 m, 8 beats of
    240 s each — satisfied the first and could not satisfy the second: 4
    stops deliver 4 x 270 s of audio and almost no walking, roughly 20 minutes
    of active time against a 54-minute floor, so every test using it refused
    with CertificationPlanningInfeasibleError.

    The fix is more anchors and real spacing, not weaker gates: a phyllotaxis
    spiral whose anchor count comes from _anchors_for_duration and whose reach
    comes from _FILLER_RADIUS_PER_SQRT_MIN (14 anchors inside ~217 m at the
    default 60 minutes). Both scale with the request, so the cluster always sits
    inside that duration's own round-trip envelope while still being spread
    enough that filling the audio target accumulates the walking the band needs.
    Beat seconds come from _auto_beat_seconds, so each anchor's whole beat set
    equals one stop's emission ceiling, which is also what makes the density
    fill ratio scale with the anchor COUNT rather than per-POI beat length.

    Pass ``duration_min`` for anything other than an hour, and ``n`` when a test
    needs an exact anchor count for its own assertion. Pass ``radius_m`` to pack
    the anchors tighter than the default: a test whose subject is a DISTANT POI
    (the endpoint pull, the far-anchor guards) needs the background cluster to
    contribute stops without contributing walking, so that its far POI stays the
    route's only source of walking seconds and cannot be traded away for a
    nearer one of equal audio. Pass ``tier=3`` with
    ``beat_count=3`` for BACKGROUND anchors: still anchor candidates as far as
    density is concerned (ANCHOR_CANDIDATE_TIER_MIN is 3, and its beat-count
    minimum is 3 too) and still able to carry the walking the band needs, but
    scored low enough that a test's own tier-5 subject wins the dwell slot it is
    being tested for.

    Fillers still carry no test-specific signal: they share one area, one tier
    and one beat budget, so spine, envelope and lens assertions read the same
    as they did when the cluster was colocated.

    This is the Père Lachaise pattern (hostile-panel finding 2026-07-02): a start

    answered by building the one-stop tour anyway and hanging a YELLOW "this area
    is thin" assessment on it, so the surfaces could explain the single stop
    rather than look broken.

    That outcome became unreachable on 2026-08-04, and the arithmetic says so

    what they would actually say: it valued every stop at a flat 300 seconds by

# Step 2.0d — FROZEN end=None ordered-POI-id identity baseline.
#
# This is a byte-for-byte guard for Steps 2.3/2.4 (B-materialization /
# endpoint handling). It pins the exact ordered POI ids select_route emits
# for a FIXED synthetic snapshot on BOTH cost paths:
#   (a) no routing client  → leg_fn=None, pace-corrected haversine divisor;
#   (b) a deterministic fake RoutingClient → routed divisor that returns
#       int(haversine_m(...)) and whose isochrone() returns None (forcing the
#       haversine reach fallback). route()/close() are no-ops/total fallback.
#
# Any future change to the selection pipeline that perturbs the end=None
# ordering for this snapshot must fail here, loudly, before it can reach the
# Step 2.3/2.4 B-materialization work that depends on this invariance.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------




#: How tightly the frozen baseline's background sits around the start.
#:
#: The background has to supply the stops and walking an hour needs while leaving
#: enough of the walk budget for the open walk to close on ``baseline-medium``.
#: Measured across a radius sweep at this geometry: 70 m and 90 m produce the
#: same ordered ids and both pull the medium anchor; the unpacked default spends
#: the whole budget on the cluster and never reaches it.
_FROZEN_BACKGROUND_RADIUS_M: float = 90.0




# FROZEN literals — captured from a green run; see the docstring above.
# These are the byte-for-byte expected ordered POI ids for end=None.
#
# Phase 3 re-baseline (Step 3.5): gate removal WIDENS the eligible pool (the
# hard tier gate, the walk_by_only exclusion, and the lens-miss exclusion are
# gone). This snapshot was DELIBERATELY re-verified under the model switch and
# the ordered ids are UNCHANGED -- by construction: every POI here is a tier-5
# 'stop' with active beats and NO lens is requested, so (a) the removed tier
# gate excluded nothing (all tier 5), (b) there are no walk_by_only POIs, and
# (c) with no lenses, lens_relevance == _lens_adjacency == 1.0, so poi_score is
# byte-identical to its pre-3.5 value. The widened eligibility therefore admits
# the same six POIs in the same order; the ends are still correct (open walk
# closes on the far 'baseline-medium' via endpoint-pull) and no crash. The new
# eligibility is exercised separately by the tier-1 / lens-miss tests above.
# C9 governor (end=None, budget/3 floor): the Step-2.0d Phase-2 byte-identity is
# DELIBERATELY superseded (DESIGN-AND-CRITIQUE ADDENDUM — the goldens are the new
# gate). Re-captured 2026-07-03 from the green C9 run: this beat-rich synthetic
# corpus caps at the ~3-stop floor (the exempt anchor's audio clears the fill
# floor, so no fill-added 4th-6th stop). The real end=None gate (Ile golden) is
# BYTE-IDENTICAL to pre-C9 (16/47), so this re-baseline moves only the fixture.
# 2026-08-05 re-baseline: the FIXTURE changed, so the captured ids had to be
# recaptured with it. A tour now has to fill the duration it was asked for, and
# the old fixture — four POIs sitting on top of the start — could not fill an
# hour at all, so every run of this baseline refused before it produced any
# ordering to compare. The background is now a duration-scaled cluster and the
# medium anchor sits far enough out for the endpoint pull to see it. What the
# baseline GUARDS is unchanged: both cost paths must agree, and the open walk
# must still close on the medium anchor.
# 2026-08-06 re-baseline: step 3B.9 made the requested duration a hard CEILING
# rather than the middle of a two-sided band. An open walk that used to be allowed
# to run 10% long now gets repaired back under the request, so it can afford
# different places — this fixture picks up filler-6 and filler-13 and no longer
# closes on the medium anchor. That is the rule working, not drift: the tour is
# shorter than the one this list captured, and it is shorter on purpose.
#
# What the baseline GUARDS is unchanged and is the reason it is still here: the
# two cost paths must produce the SAME ordering, and the ordering must be
# deterministic run to run.


# The two cost paths are REQUIRED to agree on this fixture — the deterministic
# routing client returns exactly the pace-corrected haversine the no-client path
# computes — so the routed baseline is the same list by construction. A run where
# they diverge fails whichever test diverged, which is the point.

# feeling narration. The point fixes are pinned above
# (test_endpoint_pull_never_evicts_entire_route,
# test_isolated_single_anchor_is_refused_with_the_duration_it_could_support);
# the tests below guard the CLASS: every code path that can shrink a rich

# tourability disclosure. Universal invariant, spelled out once:
#
#     len(route.pois) >= 2  OR  route.tourability is not None
#
# Since 2026-08-04 there is a third outcome, and it is the one a genuinely
# thin corpus now gets: REFUSAL. A one-stop tour cannot reach the
# certification time band at any duration the product offers, so the
# lone-anchor case named above no longer delivers a warned route — it
# declines and reports the duration the corpus could support. The invariant
# above is unchanged for every route that IS delivered.

# tourability attach). The delivered-audio invariant is deferred design —

    populations. True duplicates cluster at 0.0-1.7 m (NYSE/Wall Street, Place/Square des

    Genuinely distinct landmarks start at ~8 m: Pantheon/Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve

    filter makes the gold-standard stop structurally unbuildable.

    drops the BEST stop rather than the redundant one (a tier-5 POI with 20 beats lost to
    an arbitrary filler seated first), and it left ``_apply_fill_pass`` /
    ``_apply_endpoint_pull`` unguarded, so it did not even prevent the defect it targeted.

    Justice the listener just left -- is SEMANTIC REPETITION (check G4), not proximity.
