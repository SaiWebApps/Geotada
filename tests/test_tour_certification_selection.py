    RE-BASELINED 2026-08-06 for the hard ceiling (step 3B.9). The request is now
    the ceiling rather than 1.10 of it, which changed this fixture in two ways
    that are both the rule working:

    - The duration moved 10 -> 12 minutes. At 10 the new ceiling is 600 s and
      EVERY candidate set here prices above it, so the repair had nothing to
      choose between and the test was measuring an empty pool.
    - The winning set gained a stop. Keeping the incumbent AND adding `useful`
      lands at 658 s against a 720 s request; exchanging one for the other lands
      at 640. Under the old two-sided band both were legal and the exchange won
      on nearness to a 1.00 nominal that sat in the MIDDLE of the band. With the
      request as the ceiling, filling more of it without crossing it is simply
      the better tour, and that is what the planner now picks.

    Everything this test is named for is unchanged and still asserted: the same
    answer under a reversed candidate order, the walk-slog excluded, the
    over-ceiling stop excluded, the route ending at B, and the result in band.
