"""The visible-failure machinery, measured.

OWNER RULING 2026-07-31: *"Don't just log errors. Actually show them in the
workbench UI. Otherwise, they're invisible."* This file is the executable half of
that. It shipped once with NO tests at all, which a judge caught — a feature
whose entire purpose is "stop trusting that a problem was noticed" cannot itself
be taken on trust.

The thread test is the load-bearing one. The first version of
``degradations.py`` claimed in its docstring to be "safe to call from anywhere,
including threads". Measured, that was false: ``contextvars`` do not cross into
``ThreadPoolExecutor`` workers, so a degradation recorded inside the compose
fan-out was silently dropped — the exact invisibility this module exists to
prevent, in the module itself.

Its FIRST replacement was itself a lie, and that is the more important lesson.
``test_a_degradation_recorded_in_a_worker_thread_is_not_lost`` used the very
shape production uses — one wrap, three pool workers — but its worker body was
an instant no-op, so the three threads never actually ran at the same time. It
passed in 0.02s for three days while every real tour with two or more stops
crashed 100% of the time with ``RuntimeError: cannot enter context``. A
concurrency test whose workers do not provably overlap tests nothing. Its
replacement below, ``test_overlapping_workers_all_record_without_raising``,
forces the overlap by construction with an Event handshake — never a Barrier,
because under the bug the first worker blocks inside the entered context and a
Barrier simply deadlocks instead of reporting.

    Production wraps a callable ONCE and hands that single closure to a thread
    pool (``premium_tour.execute_premium_plan`` and ``authoring``). Real units are
    slow provider calls, so two workers are inside the wrapper at the same moment
    on every tour with two or more stops. A ``contextvars.Context`` cannot be
    entered twice at once, so that was a guaranteed ``RuntimeError: cannot enter
    context`` — every premium tour, every time, for three days.

    The overlap here is forced by construction, not hoped for: the first worker to
    arrive parks INSIDE the wrapper until the second has entered too. An Event
    handshake, deliberately not a Barrier — under the bug the parked worker never
    gets released, and a Barrier would deadlock the suite instead of reporting.

    UNDO TESTS, all three EXECUTED — a guard nobody has turned red does not exist:
      * restore the single wrap-time context in ``in_current_context`` (``snapshot.run``
        in place of ``snapshot.copy().run``) → RED with "cannot enter context";
      * move the copy inside ``_run`` (``contextvars.copy_context().run``) → the two
        propagation assertions go RED, because that copies the WORKER's empty
        context and silently drops the caller's collector;
      * drop this test's pool to ``max_workers=1`` so the two workers cannot
        overlap → RED on the handshake assertion, which is what stops this test
        passing vacuously the way its predecessor did.
