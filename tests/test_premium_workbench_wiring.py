    The free half is asserted ON THE DEFAULT PATH, with no glue client passed,
    because that is the only version of the claim that survives the next
    refactor: a path that is free only when a caller remembers to ask is one
    edit away from being paid again.

    UNDO (each turns this RED):
      * route the entry back through a K-selector (any ``select_k_routes``
        reference in the module) -> assertion 1;
      * drop the ``SilentGlueClient()`` substitution from ``plan_premium_tour``
        -> assertion 4;
      * author anything at plan time (construct a paid client) -> the _Poison
        arms raise.
