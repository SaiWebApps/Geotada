"""Phase 2 party tests — does the planner know WHO is walking?

One party-hand per file, on the `tests/test_tour_clock.py` model: every gating
test cites the design section or persona line it enforces
(specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign/04-implementation-plan.md §0.1.1).

Phase 2 party tests live here (plan steps S2.1-S2.4, S2.7, S2.8): the contract
axes and presets, the resolver, the harness flags and per-stop table, the leg
cap, pace, route surface, and the escape radius.

The RED that proved S2.2 was real: `TourInput` is `extra="forbid"`
(src/tour/contract.py), so constructing it with `party` / the axis fields
raised before the fields existed. That forbid is load-bearing for this file
and its only guard is
`tests/test_tour_contract.py::test_tour_input_rejects_extra_keys` — if that
guard ever dies, the RED here goes vacuous with it.
