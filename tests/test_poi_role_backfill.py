"""Pure (no-DB) regression test for the poi_role backfill (M0a).

Asserts the canonical poi-raw.json has no null poi_role after the backfill, that
the reviewed artifact was applied faithfully, that the over-weighting bug is
corrected (nulls were coerced to full-weight "stop" at runtime — selection.py:334
`poi_role = r.get("poi_role") or "stop"`), and that the original 102 walk_by_only
POIs were never touched. Also checks the applier is idempotent.
