"""Step 1.5b — automated narration-coherence gate (web-first verification).

Generates a real Paris tour against the live dev graph (port 7687) and asserts
the stitched per-stop narration is COHERENT — every stop non-empty, opens with a
cold-open, closes with closing glue, each stop carries beat narration, and the
validation gate passes. Catches stitcher regressions (dropped sentences, empty
or glue-only stops, missing open/close) WITHOUT mobile or a human listen.

Live-graph, golden-style, routed through the internal golden shard in
``make test``. Missing dev Neo4j is a failure.
