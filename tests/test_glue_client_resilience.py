"""A failed transition sentence must not destroy the tour.

``HaikuGlueClient`` writes the one-line links between stops ("Walk southwest for
about five minutes"). It became the production default on 2026-07-31, replacing a
canned client that could not fail. It shipped with NO exception handling and no
tests of its own, so any provider hiccup on a decorative sentence propagated out
of ``generate()`` and took the whole tour with it.

Measured the day it was found: with ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` blank, the Anthropic
SDK raises ``TypeError("Could not resolve authentication method")`` from inside
``stitch``, and ``POST /trips/preview`` answered **HTTP 500 in 3.3s**. The route
has a Basic-lane fallback for exactly this situation and never reached it,
because the failure happened during PLANNING, before the try block that degrades.

Glue is the cheapest thing in the tour and the least load-bearing. The engine
already has the right answer for "no glue available" — ``NO_GLUE_SENTINEL``,
which callers turn into a deterministic template sentence via
``_coerce_glue_output(out, default=template_nav)``. The client simply never
returned it on failure. These tests pin that it does.
