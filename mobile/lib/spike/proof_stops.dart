/// The two on-device proof pages' shared plumbing.

/// Both pages drop stops around the tester and walk to them with the phone
/// locked, and both were building those stops and caching their clip with their
/// own private copy of the same twenty lines. One copy, here — the two drifted
/// apart the moment either was touched, which is the whole of CLAUDE.md rule 1.
///
/// These pages exist because a green test suite is not evidence for background
/// audio: the simulator and a real iPhone disagreed about it once already, and
/// the only proof that counts is a locked phone in a pocket on a pavement.

/// Wider than a real doorway, on purpose.
///
/// Measured GPS cross-track is around ten metres, so a walker crossing a bare
/// 10 m circle can pass straight through it without a single fix landing
/// inside — and the proof would prove nothing. Twenty metres trips reliably
/// while still requiring the tester to START outside it and walk in.
///
/// It rides the STOP, exactly as a server-placed footprint does. There is no
/// service-wide radius to set: a 140 m courtyard and a doorway are different
/// places, and one number cannot say so.
