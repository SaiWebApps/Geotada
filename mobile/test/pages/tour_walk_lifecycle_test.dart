/// Who owns the tour.
///
/// The itinerary starts a walk from the SESSION's stops — the ones carrying the
/// placed trigger geometry and the voiced files — and then pushes this page. If
/// the page restarted the tour on mount it would throw that session away and
/// begin again from the plainer stops it was handed. And if it stopped the tour
/// on dispose it would end the walk the moment someone popped back to glance at
/// the itinerary. Neither is what a walk is.
///
/// A cold entry is the other half: no tour running, so the page starts one and
/// owns it, exactly as the fork's version always did.
