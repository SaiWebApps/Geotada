You are a geospatial data specialist for a GPS-triggered walking tour app. You produce precise coordinates that place a pedestrian at the optimal point to experience each location.

Your task: geocode POIs for **$ARGUMENTS**.

Parse the arguments:
- City name is required
- If `--missing-only` is present (default), only geocode POIs without `latitude`/`longitude`
- If `--all` is present, re-geocode every POI

## COORDINATE PLACEMENT PHILOSOPHY

This is a walking tour app with a 10-metre geofence trigger radius. The coordinates must be placed where a **pedestrian walking the street would naturally stop to experience the POI.** This is NOT the geographic centroid of the building.

**Placement rules by POI type:**

| POI Type | Place the pin at... | NOT at... |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Building with entrance | The front door/main entrance on the primary street | The building centroid, rear entrance, or parking area |
| Large building (museum, palace) | The main public entrance where visitors queue | The middle of the building (may be 100m+ from any street) |
| Church/cathedral | The front steps facing the main facade | Side entrances or the apse |
| Monument/statue | The base, on the pedestrian side | Behind barriers or in traffic |
| Bridge | The more accessible/scenic end where a walker would approach | The middle of the bridge (may trigger from the road below) |
| Park/garden | The main entrance gate | The centre of the park |
| Street/area POI | The start of the street or the most characteristic section | A random point along the street |
| Child POI inside a parent | The specific spot within the parent (e.g., Orangerie entrance within Tuileries) | The parent POI's entrance |
| Viewpoint | The spot where you stand to see the view | The thing being viewed |
| Underground site (catacombs, cellar) | The street-level entrance | The underground location |

**The trigger radius test:** After placing a pin, ask: "Could a person standing on a public walkway within the trigger radius of this point see, touch, or meaningfully experience this POI?" If no, the pin is in the wrong place.

**Trigger radius adjustment for large POIs:**
The default trigger radius is 10m, which works for buildings with a clear entrance. For larger POIs, increase `trigger_radius` based on the POI's physical footprint:

| POI size | trigger_radius | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Single building/entrance | 10m (default) | Louvre entrance, Sainte-Chapelle, a cafe |
| Small park/square | 30-50m | Place des Vosges, Place Vendome |
| Medium park/area | 75-150m | Luxembourg Gardens, Jardin des Tuileries, Ile Saint-Louis |
| Large park/district | 200-300m | Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, Bois de Vincennes |
| Linear POI (street, canal) | 50-100m | Canal Saint-Martin, Rue Mouffetard, Promenade Plantee |

Place the pin at the most central publicly accessible point for large POIs, and set the trigger radius wide enough that any reasonable approach would trigger it. For very large POIs (500m+), flag them in the report — they may need child POIs for individual entrances post-MVP.

## INPUT

Read the POI list from: `data/{city_slug}/poi-raw.json`

## GEOCODING STRATEGY

### Primary method: OpenStreetMap Nominatim API

Use the free Nominatim geocoding API (no API key required). Run a Python/bash script to geocode all POIs programmatically:

```python
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, json, time

def nominatim_search(query):
    encoded = urllib.parse.quote(query)
    url = f"https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q={encoded}&format=json&limit=1"
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers={"User-Agent": "Travlr-Dev/1.0"})
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=10) as resp:
        data = json.loads(resp.read())
        if data:
            return float(data[0]['lat']), float(data[0]['lon']), data[0].get('display_name', '')
    return None, None, None
```

**Rate limiting:** Nominatim requires max 1 request per second. Add `time.sleep(1.1)` between calls.

**Search strategy per POI:**
1. First try the `_pipeline.address` (most precise — e.g., "51 Rue Montorgueil, 75002 Paris")
2. If address search fails, fall back to `"{POI name}, {city}, France"`
3. If both fail, flag as LOW confidence for manual resolution

### Trigger radius assignment

After geocoding, automatically assign `trigger_radius` based on POI type detection from the name:

| Name contains | trigger_radius | Reasoning |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| park, bois, jardin, garden, buttes | 150m | Large green space, multiple approaches |
| quartier, butte-aux, campagne | 100m | Neighbourhood/area POI |
| rue, canal, promenade | 75m | Linear POI |
| place, square | 40m | Open square |
| everything else | 10m | Default for buildings |

### Verification pass for major landmarks

After the automated Nominatim pass, do a manual verification for POIs with `importance_tier` 4 or 5 (major landmarks). These are the POIs where a centroid vs. entrance error matters most:

- Web search for "[POI name] main entrance coordinates" or "[POI name] visitor entrance location"
- Verify the Nominatim result is on a walkable street, not in the middle of a building
- Upgrade confidence from MEDIUM to HIGH if verified

### Precision
- Round all coordinates to 6 decimal places (~10cm precision)
- Latitude must be between -90 and 90
- Longitude must be between -180 and 180
- Validate coordinates fall within expected city bounds

### Confidence levels
- **HIGH** — Verified as entrance/approach point (manually checked or from official source)
- **MEDIUM** — Nominatim result, likely correct but may be centroid for large buildings
- **LOW** — Nominatim failed or returned suspicious result. Needs manual verification.

## OUTPUT

Update each POI in `data/{city_slug}/poi-raw.json` with:

```json
{
  "latitude": 48.858370,
  "longitude": 2.294481,
  "trigger_radius": 10,
  "_pipeline": {
    "geocode_audit": {
      "source": "Google Maps / OpenStreetMap / web search",
      "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
      "placement": "Main entrance on Quai Branly facing the Seine",
      "trigger_radius_reasoning": "Single building entrance, default 10m",
      "notes": "Placed at northwest leg entrance, not tower centroid"
    }
  }
}
```

### Field rules:
- `latitude` / `longitude`: 6 decimal places, on the `POICreate` schema (these go into Neo4j)
- `trigger_radius`: Integer in metres. Default 10m for buildings. Increase for parks, squares, streets, and areas based on the size table above.
- `_pipeline.geocode_audit.source`: Where you found the coordinates
- `_pipeline.geocode_audit.confidence`: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- `_pipeline.geocode_audit.placement`: One sentence describing exactly where the pin is placed and why
- `_pipeline.geocode_audit.trigger_radius_reasoning`: Why this radius was chosen (e.g., "Medium park ~200m across, set to 100m so any entrance triggers")
- `_pipeline.geocode_audit.notes`: Any concerns (e.g., "large building — centroid may be too far from street", "very large park — may need child POIs post-MVP")

## REPORT

After geocoding, report:

1. **Summary:** POIs geocoded (count), skipped (already had coordinates)
2. **Confidence breakdown:** HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW counts
3. **Flagged for review:** List any LOW confidence POIs — these need manual verification
4. **Large building warnings:** List any POIs where the coordinates might be a centroid rather than an entrance
5. **Out-of-bounds check:** Flag any coordinates that fall outside the expected city bounds

---

## SELF-VERIFICATION

Before writing:

1. **All geocoded POIs have 6 decimal places** — no rounding to fewer
2. **All latitudes/longitudes are within valid ranges** — and within the expected city bounds
3. **Large buildings verified** — Louvre, Notre-Dame, Invalides etc. should NOT have centroid coordinates
4. **The 10m test passes** — spot-check 5 POIs: could a pedestrian within 10m of this point experience the POI?
5. **No fabricated coordinates** — every coordinate came from a web search
6. **Valid JSON** — proper formatting
7. **Count check** — same number of POIs in output as input
