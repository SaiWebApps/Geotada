"""Collect a city's body places — public toilets and benches — from OpenStreetMap.

WHY A SECOND OVERPASS FETCH AND NOT A FLAG ON THE OPENING-HOURS PASS. One script
answers one question (`scripts/poi_opening_hours.py`'s own header records the
precedent). That pass matches NAMED tourist elements to the narrated POIs already
in ``poi-raw.json`` and hands the result to a model for an audited judgement.
This pass asks a different question of the same API: it collects UNNAMED amenity
nodes (``amenity=toilets``, ``amenity=bench`` / ``leisure=bench``), matches them
to nothing, calls NO model ($0 end to end), and writes a SEPARATE file. What IS
shared is imported rather than copied: ``OVERPASS_URL`` (the one endpoint
constant) comes from the opening-hours pass, and ``assert_ingestable`` /
``ONBOARD_USER_AGENT`` come from ``src/onboard/fetch.py`` — the guarded-door,
descriptive-User-Agent pattern (Overpass 406s an anonymous client; W1.8 paid for
that lesson). The one-retry-then-abort rule is the same as
``poi_opening_hours.fetch_osm_hours``: Overpass unreachable after 2 attempts
aborts nonzero, never a silent pass, because a body-places file that silently
came out empty would read as "this city has no toilets".

WHERE THE RESULTS GO, AND WHERE THEY MUST NEVER GO. Records land in
``data/{slug}/body-places.json`` — NEVER in ``poi-raw.json``. Body places are
not narrated places: they carry no beats, no tier judgement, no story, and must
never enter the beat pipeline or the dedup/review flows that read the POI file.
The upload half (owned by plan step S2.5's coordinating session) reads this file
and uploads each record with ``poi_role="body"``; the planner prices the "body"
role at 0.0 in ``POI_ROLE_MULTIPLIER``, so a body place can never seat as a
narrated stop — only the cadence axis may ever schedule one.

WHY THE DATA EXISTS AT ALL (redesign, specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign):
design §3.1 makes body stops first-class promises — "a rest window with no bench
under it is thirteen minutes standing on a stick" (01-design.md:158-161). Nadia's
toilet stop is "ten minutes, zero cultural content, entirely non-negotiable"
(docs/personas/03-family-with-children.md step 5), and Rosemary's bench IS a
stop, with a location and a duration (docs/personas/05-step-free-visitor.md
steps 3 and 7).

RECORD SHAPE, one object per OSM node, sorted by (kind, osm id) for stable
diffs::

    {
      "id": "body-toilet-<osmid>" | "body-bench-<osmid>",   # stable across runs
      "kind": "toilet" | "bench",
      "lat": <float>,
      "lng": <float>,
      "poi_role": "body"
    }

USAGE. ``--slug`` picks the city (default paris; the bbox comes from
``src.city_registry.bbox_map()``, the one bbox table). ``--limit N`` is the dry
run: it prints the first N records and WRITES NOTHING. Exits nonzero when the
fetch fails.
