"""Score the owner's own GOLD TEXT with the real rubric. $0, no DB, no provider.

WHY
---
``make score-saved-tours`` measured 191 real tours and found two WARN checks — C9 (mean
sentence length) and C10 (look-cue opener) — firing on **100%** of them. A check that never
passes discriminates nothing.

BOTH ARE NOW RESOLVED, and in OPPOSITE directions (2026-07-27) — this script is what
settled which was which. C9's cap was retuned 15 -> 20, because C9 ranked the gold above
34 of 38 machine stops and only its threshold was wrong. C10 was DELETED, because it was a
regex over 18 sentence-initial verbs that rated the gold's own opener "a bare fact".
Openers are now UNCHECKED until G1 ships — see
tests/test_tour_quality_rubric.py::test_openers_are_unchecked_since_c10_was_deleted.

There are two possible explanations demanding opposite fixes:

  1. every generated tour really is worse than the bar, or
  2. the bar sits somewhere the owner's OWN gold text cannot reach either.

This settles it by running the SAME rubric over the gold text in
``specs/2026-07-19-tour-quality-standard/01-standard.md`` §1 — the passage the owner wrote
by hand and from which S1-S10 were derived. **A check the gold fails is mis-calibrated.**

READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING A NUMBER
----------------------------------
**Failing a check and being WORSE THAN MACHINE OUTPUT are different questions**, and
conflating them already produced one wrong recommendation here. The gold fails C9 — but it
also ranks BETTER than 34 of 38 machine stops on the very same measure. So C9's THRESHOLD
is wrong while C9 itself orders the two correctly. Deleting it would have thrown away a
working signal. Use ``--compare`` to print that ranking alongside the verdict; never quote
the pass/fail line on its own.

Related trap: ``mean_sentence_words`` is what C9 reads, and it is NOT total words divided
by total sentences. An earlier version of this script printed the naive figure in its
header and the rubric's figure two lines below, and let the reader pick. Only the rubric's
number appears now.

HOW IT SCORES
-------------
The gold is one continuous narration at one place, so it is rehydrated into a single-stop
``Script`` and passed to the REAL ``quality_rubric.score_tour``. Nothing is
re-implemented — an earlier version hand-rolled C5 and diverged from it (the real one
lowercases and skips sentences under five words).

Some checks cannot mean anything for a single passage of prose and are filtered out and
listed as NOT APPLICABLE rather than reported as passes:

  * C4-imbalance — one stop is trivially 100% of the tour
  * C3-thin / C7 / C7b — need a requested duration, a route and walking legs
  * C1-starved — needs the live corpus map
  * C2-tier-inversion, C12-stops-too-close, C11-year-density-outlier — need >1 stop or POI

What genuinely IS measured: **C5** (verbatim repetition), **C6** (empty stop), **C8**
(gorging) and **C9**. C10 no longer exists.

The gold text is extracted STRUCTURALLY — the markdown blockquote under the §1 heading,
matched on line prefixes, never a pattern match. See ``extract_gold_text``.
