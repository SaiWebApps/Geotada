"""The audit table for POI visit capacity — how a non-visitor checks the capacity pass.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The capacity pass (`scripts/poi_visit_duration.py`) prices 370
Paris places, and nobody reviewing the result has been to most of them. Paris facts
cannot be checked by the person who has to sign this off. So the review is
STRUCTURAL, and this report is what makes that possible: it puts the extremes and
the reasoning side by side, where a wrong number shows up as an implausible
RELATIONSHIP rather than as a wrong fact.

THE THREE CHECKS IT IS BUILT TO SUPPORT (the plan's Phase 2 verification):

1. A niche museum has a HIGH inside capacity despite a LOW tier. If importance
   leaked into the number, the top-20 table is where it shows — it will read as a
   list of famous places instead of a list of absorbing ones.
2. A street, bridge or square has NO inside capacity. The "nothing to enter"
   section exists so that is visible rather than inferred.
3. The biggest monuments land in a plausible SPREAD, not all pinned at one value.

WHY THE CORRIDOR SECTION EXISTS. A parish church's interior is neither top-20 nor
bottom-20 of 370, so the extremes alone cannot answer the one question the plan
asks before Phase 3 starts: do the interiors between Rue Royale and Notre-Dame
carry enough visit time between them to fill roughly two and a half hours? The
corridor section lists exactly those places so that question is answerable by
reading, not by guessing.
