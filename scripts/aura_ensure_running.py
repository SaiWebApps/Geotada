"""Wake a PAUSED Aura instance and BLOCK until the database answers.

The free prod Aura auto-pauses after ~3 days; while paused its DNS is withdrawn
(connections fail with NXDOMAIN). Every `-cloud` make target runs this FIRST so a
paused instance is resumed and awaited instead of being mistaken for a dead one
(the 2026-07-12 incident — see feedback-paused-aura-is-not-dead). Unlike the
request-path ResumeCoordinator (fire-and-forget), a deploy MUST wait, so this
polls to completion.

READINESS IS THE DATABASE ANSWERING, never a status string. Aura reports two
things independently: a CONTROL-PLANE lifecycle status (`GET /v1/instances/{id}`,
what the console's instance list shows) and the Bolt endpoint the data actually
travels on. They disagree by design — an instance under a rolling `updating`
keeps serving queries throughout, which is why the console can show `UPDATING`
and `connected` at the same moment. Measured 2026-09-03: this script polled a
`updating` instance to its 300 s timeout and failed the cloud shard while
`make db-parity TARGET=cloud` passed against that same instance completely.
`updating` is not even in the status vocabulary ``src.aura_resume`` documents,
so it was neither accepted nor terminal — just unrecognised, and fatal.

So the status is consulted for exactly one thing: deciding whether to fire a
resume and whether it is still worth waiting. What ENDS the wait is a real
read-only query coming back, which is the same evidence `healthz` reports and
what `.claude/rules/testing.md` requires of any probe.

Safe NO-OP when AURA_CLIENT_ID/SECRET are unset (local dev / CI / a self-hosted
graph): prints a note and exits 0, so it never blocks a non-Aura target.
