"""The human-authored reference tours, loaded as scoreable ``Script`` objects.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``score_gold_text.py`` scores the owner's gold passage — 509 words, one stop. That
calibrates the PROSE checks and nothing else: checks that need more than one stop, a
duration, or a route report NOT APPLICABLE on a single passage, so they had never been
calibrated against anything a human approved.

``Docs/tour-builder/empirical-tours/`` holds two COMPLETE human-written tours,
hand-composed from the live corpus on 2026-04-26 and recorded in the goldens as the
reference for what a good tour contains. This module turns them into ``Script`` +
``Route`` pairs so the REAL ``quality_rubric.score_tour`` can run on them unchanged.
Nothing here re-implements a check or softens a threshold.

TWO GRANULARITIES — THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT
-------------------------------------------
A first version of this loader promoted EVERY narration-owning heading to a stop and
reported "0 blockers" on both tours. A judge consult killed that commit: the Île
document declares its stops explicitly (``## STOP — …``, 8 of them, matching the 8
POIs its golden fixture records), and grouped the document's own way, two stops
exceed the C8 gorge cap. The zero was an artifact of segmentation, not calibration.

So the loader now models both units, because they answer different questions:

* **stop** — the document's declared unit (a named place; what the rubric's
  ``stop_idx`` means on machine output, where a stop is a POI with one GPS trigger).
* **position** — the deepest narration-owning heading (one standing/pointing spot;
  inside a big stop the tourist WALKS between positions: facade, portal, nave…).

MEASURED 2026-07-29, unmodified rubric, both granularities:

    Île de la Cité, BY DECLARED STOP (12 sections):
        Conciergerie 901 words, Notre-Dame 1595 words -> C8-gorged FIRES on both.
        Every other section is 31-425 words.
    Île de la Cité, BY POSITION (29): widest 367 words -> zero blockers.
    Place des Vosges (no STOP markers; a circumnavigation of one square where each
    paused-at house IS the stop; 25 positions): widest 239 words -> zero blockers.
    Place des Vosges, BY LEVEL-2 SECTION — the read this loader deliberately does
    NOT take: 4 sections, one of them ``CIRCUMNAVIGATION`` at 2744 words, which
    would be a third C8 blocker. That read is wrong — nobody stands at a section
    called CIRCUMNAVIGATION; it is 22 house-by-house pauses of ~125 words each —
    but the figure is recorded here so the suppression is auditable, and the
    no-markers branch is pinned by test so the rule cannot flip silently.

The contradiction is the calibration finding, and it is deliberately NOT resolved
here: per standing position, human practice never exceeds ~370 words (the 850 cap is
generous); per named POI, humans go to 1595 when the POI has interior structure to
walk through. Whether C8's unit should be the position (needs sub-location-aware
stops in the engine) or the POI (needs a cap the reference can pass) is a product
decision. The calibration tests in ``tests/test_tour_quality_rubric.py`` pin BOTH
measurements so the decision cannot be made silently.

WHICH CHECKS THIS HARNESS ACTUALLY EXERCISES — honesty over coverage claims
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Live here: C3 (thin), C5 (verbatim repeat), C8 (gorged), and the WARNs C4, C9, C11.
Structurally silent, and why:

    C1-starved   needs the corpus beat map; we pass ``beats_by_poi={}``
    C2-tier      needs route vignettes; the documents have none
    C6-empty     the parser drops narration-free headings, so a 0-word stop
                 cannot exist by construction
    C7 / C7b     need a planned time budget / per-leg transits; not in the documents
    C12-too-close  the documents carry no coordinates; the loader synthesizes
                 spread-out ones, so C12 is NOT calibrated here — even though the
                 Île tour contains the very adjacency (Conciergerie / Palais) that
                 C12's provenance cites. Real-coordinate calibration needs the
                 corpus, not this file.

PARSING
-------
Plain string operations only — never a regular expression. The two documents do not
share a tag vocabulary (``[PW:...]`` vs ``[RG:...]``/``[F:...]``/``[V:...]``, with
``+``-joined pairs), and a pattern written for the first silently returned ZERO
matches on the second. Structure, not pattern: a heading line opens a section, a
``>`` line is narration, a ``**[...]**`` span is a provenance marker and is removed.
