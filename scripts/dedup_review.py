"""Does this codebase answer the same question in two places?

WHY THIS IS A REVIEWER AND NOT A LINT RULE. The duplication that has actually cost
this project was SEMANTIC, not textual. The tour algorithm existed once for the
phone and once for the workbench; the two shared no lines, no names and no
structure, and reuniting them became its own project (``c8a35a75``). No pattern
scan can see that. A regex, a substring search, even an AST shape hash all answer
"does this text appear twice" — and for the expensive duplicate the answer is no.

The question that finds it is "what is this code FOR?", and answering that needs
reading. So this reads.

WHY IT IS IN THE BUILD AND NOT AN AGENT SOMEONE INVOKES. The thing that keeps
producing this defect is a coding model, and a rule a model has to remember is the
same as no rule. ``CLAUDE.md`` records the precedent: prose caps were tried and
died when ``/dev``'s loop counters called a hook that did not exist.

TWO MODES, because one guard cannot be both fast enough to run after every edit and
thorough enough to be believed at the end.

``--changed`` runs after edits. It asks ONE question — does this new or changed
code answer a question the codebase already answers? — against a cached inventory
of what everything else is for. It is advisory ON PURPOSE. A multi-file change is
legitimately incoherent in the middle: this repo's own plan has a step where the
app must raise until the next step lands. A guard that blocks there gets switched
off, and a guard that is off catches nothing. The precedent is in ``CLAUDE.md``:
a regex command guard blocked 16 of 20 harmless commands, caught 0 of 70 real
ones, and was deleted.

``--full`` runs at close and BLOCKS. Three passes over everything, and it is what
the pre-commit bar reads. Ignoring the advisory one in the moment is fine.
Ignoring this one is not possible.

THE THREE PASSES, because the middle one is where the reasoning is.

1. NAME THE RESPONSIBILITY. One call per module. For every function, the model
   states in one plain sentence the single question it answers. Bodies are
   included, because a name and a docstring are exactly what a forked
   implementation gets right while diverging underneath.

2. GROUP BY RESPONSIBILITY. One call over the whole inventory — sentences only, no
   bodies, so the model holds the entire codebase at once. This is the pass that
   catches a fork: two entries whose sentences say the same thing, however
   different their code.

3. RULE ON EACH GROUP, with the real bodies, in a separate call. A model grouping
   on one-line summaries WILL over-group; this is the check on it, and it gets the
   evidence so a superficial resemblance can be dismissed on the code.

FAILING CLOSED. A group the ruling pass cannot decide is REPORTED, not passed. An
unreviewable answer is not a clean one.
