"""Price the QUEUE at every POI — the queue pass (redesign data row 6.5, plan W3.1).

EXTENDS ``scripts/poi_visit_duration.py`` — same corpus file, same batched audited-AI
shape, same round-trip write guard (``load_pois`` / ``dump_pois`` are IMPORTED from it,
not copied, so the refuse-to-write-on-reformat guard stays defined once), the same
reader of a model reply (``records_for_batch``: fence, parse, alignment), and the same
window grammar as the opening-hours pass (``_TIME_RE`` is imported, not restated, so
"what is a valid HH:MM" keeps exactly one definition). It is a separate script because
it answers a DIFFERENT QUESTION (the header rule in ``scripts/poi_visit_duration.py``):
not how long a place absorbs a visitor, not when its door is open, but how long the
LINE in front of that door costs — a fourth kind of time
(specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign/01-design.md:178-184, §3.3): "a queue is
priced separately, by hour and season, it belongs to the day rather than to the
building, and it is excluded entirely under `wall`".

WHAT IT PRODUCES, per POI in ``data/{slug}/poi-raw.json``
(specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign/01-design.md:369, data row 6.5):

``queue_class``           ``none | short | long | unpredictable``. ``none`` means no
                          line exists to stand in — a street, a bridge, a square, an
                          ungated church door. ``unpredictable`` is the catacombs
                          class: a wait that CANNOT BE BOUNDED, which §2.3
                          (01-design.md:106) bans from ever being offered under a
                          ``wall`` end — Marcus's row-6.5 half.
``queue_minutes_peak``    Integer minutes of line at the WORST normal hour.
``queue_minutes_offpeak`` Integer minutes of line at a quiet hour. Peak >= off-peak
                          by definition; both 0 for ``none``.
``queue_peak_hours``      The daily hour bands when the peak applies — a list of
                          ``["HH:MM", "HH:MM"]`` windows, exactly the window
                          encoding ``opening_hours`` already uses (one grammar for
                          clock ranges, defined once). ``[]`` when no band is worse
                          than the rest.
``queue_basis``           ONE sentence arguing for the class and both numbers,
                          judgeable by someone who has never been to the city.

THE QUEUE IS THE WAIT BEFORE ENTERING — security and ticket line — AND IT IS PRICED
SEPARATELY FROM VISIT TIME. ``visit_seconds_inside`` currently folds a typical queue
into the visit (owner ruling 2026-08-06: the basis sentence records the split so a
later pass "can separate the two without re-pricing the city"); this pass is that
later pass. Camille's Sainte-Chapelle is the anchor: 28 minutes of line plus 38 under
the glass are TWO facts (docs/personas/01-architecture-pilgrim.md), and folding them
into one 66 makes the wait permanent — unskippable by someone who only wants the
outside, unshrinkable at opening time (01-design.md:180-182).

REVIEW AT THE STANDARD RATE, WITH NAMED SPOT CHECKS. Unlike row 6.4's judgements,
queues have observable external sources (timed-ticket pages, institutions' own
"expect security lines" guidance), so the double-rate rule does not apply. The
reviewer MUST individually check: the Louvre, Sainte-Chapelle, the Musée d'Orsay,
and every row classed ``unpredictable`` (the catacombs class) — the marquee lines a
wrong number would misprice for the most visitors, and the class that changes what a
``wall`` day may be offered at all.

SPEND. One model call per batch of POIs, so a full Paris pass is roughly
370 / BATCH_SIZE calls (~25). ``--limit`` runs a subset and ``--dry-run`` writes
nothing; both are the intended way to inspect output before committing to a full pass.

PROMPT_HEADER = """\
You are pricing the QUEUE at each place on a walking tour: the security and ticket \
line a visitor stands in BEFORE entering. One class, two numbers, the hour bands \
when the line peaks, and a sentence that argues them.

READ THIS FIRST — IT IS THE MOST COMMON WAY THIS TASK GOES WRONG.

The queue is NOT visit time and NOT a rating of popularity. It is the wait between \
joining the line outside and getting in, priced separately from however long the \
visit inside takes. A world-famous place can have no line at all (big doors, no \
ticket) and a modest one can have a long one (timed entry, one small door). Price \
the LINE, never the fame.

THE CLASSES:

- `none` — there is no line to stand in: a street, a bridge, a square, a garden \
gate, a church you walk straight into. A place with no interior at all is always \
`none`.
- `short` — a line exists but is minor at its worst: a bag check that moves, a \
ticket desk with a few people at it.
- `long` — a substantial line is a normal part of entering at busy hours.
- `unpredictable` — the wait CANNOT BE BOUNDED: entry is throttled to a trickle, \
and the line can be twenty minutes or three hours with no way to know which \
(the catacombs class). The planner refuses to promise these under a hard end \
time, so use this class only when the variance is the famous fact about the place.

CALIBRATION, matched to real observed days:

- Sainte-Chapelle: `long`, peak 30, off-peak 10, peak hours [["10:30","16:00"]]. \
Airport-style security plus a ticket check ahead of a small chapel; the observed \
day behind this corpus stood 28 minutes in it.
- The Louvre (pyramid entrance): `long`, peak 40, off-peak 15, peak hours \
[["10:00","15:00"]]. Security into the pyramid, then ticket gates; timed tickets \
shorten but do not remove it.
- Pont Neuf, any street, any open square: `none`, 0, 0, []. There is no door and \
no line — the whole value stands in the open.
- A parish church with an open door: `none`, 0, 0, []. A door you walk through \
without stopping is not a queue.
- The Catacombs: `unpredictable`, peak 120, off-peak 45, peak hours \
[["11:00","17:00"]]. Entry is capped to a few hundred people underground at once, \
so the line moves at a trickle and cannot be bounded; the numbers are the typical \
case, and the basis must say the bound is untrustworthy.

FOR EACH PLACE, RETURN:

1. `queue_class` — exactly one of "none", "short", "long", "unpredictable".

2. `queue_minutes_peak` — integer minutes of line at the WORST normal hour. 0 for \
`none`. At least 1 for every other class: a line that never costs a minute is \
`none`.

3. `queue_minutes_offpeak` — integer minutes at a quiet hour (opening time, late \
afternoon). Never more than the peak. 0 for `none`.

4. `queue_peak_hours` — the daily hour bands when the peak number applies, as a \
list of ["HH:MM","HH:MM"] windows on the 24-hour clock (["11:00","16:00"] is one \
band). [] for `none`, and [] when the line is constant rather than peaked — but if \
your peak number is HIGHER than your off-peak number, you are claiming a peak \
exists and must say WHEN it is.

5. `queue_basis` — ONE sentence arguing the class and both numbers, written for a \
reviewer who has never been to this city. Name the mechanism — security screening, \
timed tickets, one small door, capped occupancy — never "popular" or "busy", which \
argue nothing. For `unpredictable`, say WHY the wait cannot be bounded.

RULES THAT MATTER:

- Price the wait BEFORE entering only. Time inside, however crowded, is visit \
time and is priced elsewhere.
- Peak vs off-peak is BY HOUR OF DAY. Where season moves the line (summer doubles \
it), price the busy season and say so in the basis.
- If you do not know the place, say so in `queue_basis` and default toward `none` \
for open places and `short` for small ticketed interiors — never invent a famous \
line.
- Return STRICT JSON only: an array with one object per place, in the same order, \
each with keys `name`, `queue_class`, `queue_minutes_peak`, \
`queue_minutes_offpeak`, `queue_peak_hours`, `queue_basis`. No prose before or \
after, no markdown fence.
