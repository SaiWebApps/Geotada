"""Price how long a visitor spends AT each POI — the capacity pass behind /poi-visit-duration.

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A PROMPT. Nineteen of the twenty-one files in
``.claude/commands/`` are prompts a model reads, with no program behind them, and
no Makefile target invokes one — Make cannot run a prompt. Two commands do have a
backing script (``beat-dedup`` -> ``scripts/beat_dedup.py``, ``tour-build`` ->
``scripts/tour_build.py``), and this follows that precedent so the pass has a
repeatable, preflighted, dry-runnable executor instead of depending on an agent
session that cannot be re-run identically.

WHAT IT PRODUCES, per POI in ``data/{slug}/poi-raw.json``:

``typical_duration_min``  How long a visitor usefully spends at the place WITHOUT
                          going inside — the forecourt, the facade, the square.
                          The field already exists on ``POICreate``
                          (``src/api/models/nodes.py:141``); this fills it. Only
                          2 of Paris's 370 entries carried it before this pass.
``visit_seconds_inside``  How long a visitor usefully spends INSIDE, including
                          any queue. ``null`` for a place with no interior — a
                          street, a bridge, a square.
``visit_basis``           One sentence that argues for both numbers, written so
                          somebody who has never been to Paris can judge it.

WHY TWO NUMBERS. One number cannot serve two visitors. Camille gives
Sainte-Chapelle 38 minutes inside plus 28 more in the queue to get in; Theo gives
the same building 15 from the outside and never goes in
(``docs/personas/02-dark-history-walker.md:77``). The pair is what lets an
interest change how long you stay, not only where you go.

QUEUES COUNT, AND THE BASIS SENTENCE RECORDS THE SPLIT (owner ruling 2026-08-06).
``visit_seconds_inside`` is the honest elapsed cost of going in, queue included,
because this release exists to make the tour's clock match the tourist's day and
Release 1 has no concept of what time of day it is — a queue excluded here is
simply lost, and every ticketed interior would quietly under-run. The basis
sentence must state the split ("28 minutes of queue plus 38 under the glass") so
Release 2's opening-hours work can separate the two without re-pricing the city.

THE NUMBERS ARE ARGUED FOR, NOT ASSERTED. ``visit_basis`` exists because nobody
reviewing this data has been to most of these places. A number with no sentence
behind it is unauditable, so this script refuses to write one.

SPEND. One model call per batch of POIs, so a full Paris pass is roughly
370 / BATCH_SIZE calls. ``--limit`` runs a subset and ``--dry-run`` writes nothing,
which is the intended way to inspect the output before committing to a full pass.

PROMPT_HEADER = """\
You are pricing how long a visitor usefully spends at each place on a walking \
tour. Two numbers per place, and a sentence that argues for them.

READ THIS FIRST — IT IS THE MOST COMMON WAY THIS TASK GOES WRONG.

You are pricing the place's CAPACITY: how long it can absorb somebody who \
genuinely wants to be there. You are NOT pricing an average visitor's rushed \
stop. A later stage of this system takes your number and scales it DOWN for \
visitors whose interests only partly match the place. So if you hand back a \
typical hurried visit, it gets discounted a second time and every tour comes out \
starved. **Price the engaged visitor. The system does the discounting.**

CALIBRATION, from real observed visits. Match this scale:

- Sainte-Chapelle: OUTSIDE 15 min (the facade and the courtyard are modest and \
you have seen them). INSIDE 3960 s — 28 minutes of security and ticket queue \
plus 38 minutes under the glass. Not 30 minutes. Not 20.
- The Louvre's Cour Carree: OUTSIDE 33 min for somebody who came for the \
architecture — into the courtyard, round it, out to the east colonnade, then \
standing looking up. A big enclosed courtyard absorbs half an hour.
- Place de la Concorde: OUTSIDE 35 min. An open square with an obelisk still \
absorbs half an hour, because you walk between positions on it.
- Pont Neuf: OUTSIDE 12 min, INSIDE null. A bridge is a destination, not a \
corridor, but there is nothing to enter.
- The Conciergerie: INSIDE 3900 s. The medieval hall, the tribunal, the cell.
- A parish church you can walk into: INSIDE roughly 1000-1200 s.

Notice how large the outside numbers are. **Streets, squares, gardens and \
bridges are where this pass most often under-prices, and in aggregate that is \
fatal**: they are most of a city, so pricing them at 3-5 minutes each starves \
every tour while each individual row still looks defensible.

FOR EACH PLACE, RETURN:

1. `typical_duration_min` — integer MINUTES a visitor usefully spends at the place \
WITHOUT going inside. The facade, the forecourt, the square, the view. This is \
never null and never below 2: a place nobody pauses at for two minutes is \
something you walk past, not a stop. A street or a square's whole value is \
outside, so this is its real number, not a token one.

2. `visit_seconds_inside` — integer SECONDS a visitor usefully spends INSIDE, \
INCLUDING any security or ticket queue. Use null when there is no interior to \
enter, or when entering is not a normal part of visiting: streets, bridges, \
squares, gardens, monuments you view from outside, statues, fountains. When it is \
not null it must be at least `typical_duration_min * 60`, and never more than \
5400 (90 minutes). **5400 is a hard ceiling, not a target.** A place that would \
genuinely absorb longer — a major national museum — returns 5400 AND says so in \
its basis, e.g. "would absorb three hours; capped at the 90-minute tour maximum". \
Do not drift other places up toward the ceiling to look consistent with it.

3. `visit_basis` — ONE sentence justifying both numbers, written for somebody who \
has never been to this city. Say what is physically there and how long it takes to \
see, e.g. "interior, about 30 rooms over two floors, typical visit 45-60 min plus \
a 10-min ticket queue" or "open square, one monument and a colonnade to walk \
round, nothing to enter". Never write "popular" or "worth a visit" — those argue \
nothing.

RULES THAT MATTER:

- Price the PLACE'S CAPACITY, not its fame. A small chocolate museum can absorb 90 \
minutes; a world-famous bridge absorbs 10. Importance tier is given below only so \
you know what the place is — it must NOT drive the number. This is the single \
most common way this task goes wrong.
- Include realistic queues in the inside number for places that reliably have one.
- If you do not know a place, say so in `visit_basis` and price it conservatively \
from what its name and description tell you. Do not invent specifics.
- Return STRICT JSON only: an array with one object per place, in the same order, \
each with keys `name`, `typical_duration_min`, `visit_seconds_inside`, \
`visit_basis`. No prose before or after, no markdown fence.
