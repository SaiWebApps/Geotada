"""Score every saved tour artifact against the CURRENT quality rubric. $0, no DB.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``data/{city}/tours/*.json`` holds real tours built by past runs. Each one is a
serialized ``Script``. The rubric (``quality_rubric.score_tour``) has moved on since they
were written, and nobody has ever asked it what it thinks of them. This does exactly that,
and nothing else: no generation, no provider call, no container, no Neo4j.

Run it to answer "what does today's bar actually catch on real tours?" before changing the
bar.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT MEASURED — read this before quoting a number
---------------------------------------------------------------
The saved artifact is a ``Script``. It is NOT a ``Route``, and two rubric inputs were never
persisted. Rather than reconstruct them from guesswork, the missing inputs are supplied as
EMPTY, which makes the checks that depend on them structurally inert. Those checks are
reported as NOT RUN, never as PASS — a check that could not fire is not a clean bill of
health.

  * ``beats_by_poi`` (the corpus map) is empty, so C1-starved cannot fire. It needs the
    live graph to know how many beats a POI *could* have supported. Supplying the
    artifact's own seated ``beat_ids`` instead would UNDERSTATE availability and produce a
    confidently wrong number, which is worse than a gap.
  * ``transits`` is empty, so C7b-leg-audio-overruns-walk cannot fire.
  * ``poi_role`` is not persisted on ``ScriptPOI``; a placeholder is used. Verified safe:
    ``quality_rubric`` never reads it.

The C7 time ceiling IS reconstructed, and exactly: ``routing.planned_total_seconds`` is
CALLED here, not re-derived, so the ceiling cannot drift from the engine's.
``duration_min`` comes from the persisted ``inputs``.

That helper was named ``err_short_total_seconds`` and returned a flat 0.83 of the
requested duration until 2026-08-04, when the legacy planning policy was deleted and the
nominal fraction became 1.00. THE CONSEQUENCE IS DELIBERATE AND MUST NOT BE MISREAD AS A
NO-OP RENAME: every saved tour this script scores is now judged against a 60-minute
ceiling for a 60-minute request instead of a 49.8-minute one, so C7 is about 20 percent
more permissive across the whole historical corpus. Leaving the old helper in place
would have been worse — the scorer would have kept a ceiling the engine no longer plans
to, and the "cannot drift" claim above would have become false.

THE AUDIO-CLOCK CAVEAT
----------------------
``total_audio_seconds`` did not measure audio before commit c987848 (2026-07-19): it
credited every glue sentence a flat 4s and capped beat credit at the corpus estimate. Any
artifact generated before that date carries a meaningless audio number, so C3-thin and
C7-time-budget are untrustworthy on it. Artifacts are split by ``generated_at`` and the
two cohorts are reported separately. Do not average across them.
