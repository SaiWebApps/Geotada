"""Judge three practical affordances of every POI — the place-judgements pass (design row 6.4).

EXTENDS ``scripts/poi_visit_duration.py`` — same corpus file, same batched audited-AI
shape, same round-trip write guard (``load_pois`` / ``dump_pois`` are IMPORTED from it,
not copied, so the refuse-to-write-on-reformat guard stays defined once). It is a
separate script rather than a flag on that one because it answers a DIFFERENT QUESTION:
social and physical affordances — can a child run here, can two people sit and talk
here, is it OK to be left standing here after dark — not time. Folding it in would fuse
two prompts, two validators and two review protocols into one CLI whose halves succeed
and fail independently.

WHAT IT PRODUCES, per POI in ``data/{slug}/poi-raw.json``
(specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign/01-design.md row 6.4):

``children_can_run``  Can children be loud, fast and free-range here? Nadia's finding:
                      38 of her 55 place-minutes were valuable BECAUSE the kids could
                      run, and the corpus had no channel for it
                      (specs/2026-08-07-tour-algorithm-redesign/03-panel-findings.md:160).
``sit_and_talk``      Can two people sit down somewhere quiet enough to hear each
                      other? Fiona & Dev's two green chairs: the Palais-Royal garden
                      wins their afternoon on seating, enclosure and quiet — "three
                      properties no POI in the corpus carries"
                      (docs/personas/09-couple-who-would-rather-talk.md:34-37, 75-78).
``good_after_dark``   Good to be LEFT STANDING there in the dark? The design's finish
                      rule: "a finish after dark must be somewhere rated good to be
                      left standing in the dark" (01-design.md §3.1). Consumed only in
                      Phase 3 (it needs legs priced by hour) — priced NOW so the data
                      exists when Phase 3 arrives.
``judgement_basis``   ONE sentence arguing all three verdicts, written so a reviewer
                      who has never been to the city can judge them.

THESE ARE AI JUDGEMENTS WITH NO EXTERNAL SOURCE — SAMPLE THEM AT TWICE THE NORMAL
RATE IN REVIEW. Row 6.4 is the only data row in the redesign with no external source
behind it (no OSM tag, no observable fact — 01-design.md:375-377): the model's verdict
is the whole provenance. The review step (W2.9) therefore samples these rows at twice
the rate of the externally-sourced passes, and ``judgement_basis`` exists because it is
the only audit trail a reviewer gets. This script refuses to write a verdict without it.

SPEND. One model call per batch of POIs, so a full Paris pass is roughly
370 / BATCH_SIZE calls (~25). ``--limit`` runs a subset and ``--dry-run`` writes
nothing; both are the intended way to inspect output before committing to a full pass.

PROMPT_HEADER = """\
You are judging three practical affordances of each place on a walking tour: can \
children run here, can two people sit and talk here, and is it OK to be left \
standing here after dark. Three booleans and one sentence that argues them.

READ THIS FIRST — IT IS THE MOST COMMON WAY THIS TASK GOES WRONG.

These are NOT ratings of how good, famous or pleasant a place is. Each is a \
narrow physical and social test, and a world-famous place fails them as easily \
as an obscure one. Judge what is physically and socially there — enclosure, \
traffic, seating, noise, gates, lighting — never reputation. The three are \
independent: any combination of true and false can be correct.

CALIBRATION, matched to real observed days:

- The Palais-Royal garden: children_can_run TRUE (fully enclosed, traffic-free \
gravel and lawns where a child can be loud and fast without danger or \
disapproval); sit_and_talk TRUE (movable metal chairs in a courtyard enclosed on \
all four sides, quiet enough to talk at normal volume); good_after_dark FALSE \
(the gates are locked at night, so nobody can be left standing inside it).
- The Pont Neuf: children_can_run FALSE (a road bridge with traffic down the \
middle and parapets straight onto the river); sit_and_talk FALSE (the half-moon \
bays have stone benches, but they sit metres from moving traffic and \
conversation is effort); good_after_dark TRUE (lit, open, central, people \
crossing at all hours).
- The Galerie Vivienne: all three FALSE — a narrow covered shopping arcade: \
glass shopfronts at child height, no free seating (café tables must be paid \
for), echoing enough that talking is effort, and locked after closing.

FOR EACH PLACE, RETURN:

1. `children_can_run` — true only where a child can be LOUD, FAST and \
FREE-RANGE: enclosed or traffic-free ground, room to move, nothing fragile at \
child height, nobody who will shush them. Open space is not enough — a child at \
full speed must not be able to end up in traffic. Interiors where quiet is \
expected — churches, galleries, museums — are false however family-friendly. A \
pavement beside traffic is false however famous the building.

2. `sit_and_talk` — true only where two people can SIT DOWN on real, free \
seating — benches, chairs, broad steps or low walls people actually sit on — \
somewhere QUIET enough to hold a conversation at normal volume. Standing room \
is false. Seating beside heavy traffic or inside an echoing hall is false. \
Seating you must pay for (a café terrace) does not count.

3. `good_after_dark` — true only where a tour could LEAVE SOMEONE STANDING at \
nightfall and they would be fine: lit, open (not locked or gated at night), \
with people normally about. This is about ENDING a tour, not nightlife: a \
deserted lane is false however safe it feels by day; a locked park is false \
however lovely inside.

4. `judgement_basis` — ONE sentence arguing all three verdicts, written for a \
reviewer who has never been to this city. Name the physical facts — enclosure, \
traffic, seating, noise, gates, lighting, crowds — never "popular" or \
"charming", which argue nothing. These judgements have NO external data source, \
so this sentence is the only audit trail a reviewer gets.

RULES THAT MATTER:

- If you do not know the place, say so in `judgement_basis` and judge \
conservatively from its name and description: default to false rather than \
inventing an affordance a family or a couple would then be routed to.
- Return STRICT JSON only: an array with one object per place, in the same \
order, each with keys `name`, `children_can_run`, `sit_and_talk`, \
`good_after_dark`, `judgement_basis`. Booleans must be JSON true/false, never \
strings. No prose before or after, no markdown fence.
