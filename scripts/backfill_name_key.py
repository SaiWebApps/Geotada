"""Backfill the canonical `name_key` dedup property onto existing POI nodes (defect 3).

Defect 3 was fixed by making POI creation MERGE on a canonical `name_key`
(``src/api/crud/nodes.create_node`` → ``MERGE (n:POI {name_key, city_name})``,
where ``name_key = canonical_name_key(name)``). But POIs created BEFORE that
change have no ``name_key`` property, so a re-upload or edit of an existing POI
won't dedup against them — the ``{name_key, city_name}`` MERGE cannot match a
node that lacks ``name_key`` → a duplicate node is forked. This migration
backfills ``name_key`` onto those existing nodes so future MERGEs land on them.

What it does (and does NOT do):
  - DRY-RUN by default (no writes). Reports, per city_name:
      * total POIs, how many are missing name_key (or have a stale value),
      * COLLISION CLUSTERS — sets of ≥2 existing POIs that would map to the
        same (name_key, city_name). These are pre-existing casing/whitespace
        duplicates the old (name, city_name) MERGE key never caught. They are
        SURFACED for manual review under the project's two-source / user-review
        guardrails — this script NEVER auto-merges or deletes them.
  - ``--apply`` SETs ``n.name_key = canonical_name_key(n.name)`` on every POI
    whose name_key is missing or differs from the canonical form. It is a pure
    property SET: it MERGES nothing and DELETES nothing. Re-running is a no-op
    (idempotent) once every node already carries its canonical name_key.

Uses ``canonical_name_key`` imported from ``src.api.models.nodes`` so the key is
computed identically to ``create_node`` — a single source of truth.

Safety (mirrors src/main._assert_local_target and scripts/upload_paris):
  - Refuses a non-localhost NEO4J_URI unless ``--allow-cloud`` is passed
    explicitly. The guard fires BEFORE any driver is created, so it protects
    even when Aura is paused/unreachable. Safe by default.

Usage:
    python scripts/backfill_name_key.py                    # dry-run (default)
    python scripts/backfill_name_key.py --apply            # write name_key (local)
    python scripts/backfill_name_key.py --apply --allow-cloud   # deliberate cloud run
    python scripts/backfill_name_key.py --city-name paris  # scope to one city
