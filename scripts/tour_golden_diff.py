"""Diagnostic CLI: side-by-side overlap report against a golden fixture.

Runs the full shipped pipeline (select_route → build_poi_beat_plans_capped →
generate) against the live Paris Neo4j and prints a per-POI diff against
fixtures/tour_golden/<fixture>.json, counting SCRIPT-level beats exactly like
the authoritative gate (tests/test_tour_golden_*.py) so the numbers match.

NOT a test dependency — useful when iterating on calibration knobs to see
exactly which beats land where.

Usage:
    python scripts/tour_golden_diff.py pdv_round_trip_60min
    python scripts/tour_golden_diff.py ile_oneway_90min
