"""Trusted, corpus-side place semantics used before tour selection.

These contracts deliberately live outside :mod:`src.tour.artifact`.  Corpus
annotations describe source sentences and the places at which their narration
is valid; artifact evidence describes the *final*, potentially composed text.
Keeping the two layers separate prevents a source annotation from being
silently treated as authority for text that a model later changed.

Every aggregate is immutable and hash-bound.  A hash proves replay identity,
not trust: the certification coordinator must still allow-list ``authority_id``
from the frozen corpus build.
