"""THE TOUR QUALITY RUBRIC — the mechanical floor that runs on every tour.

Full standard, gold examples and threshold provenance:
``specs/2026-07-19-tour-quality-standard/01-standard.md``. Read it before changing a
number here; every threshold there is either MEASURED, INHERITED from the engine, or
CITED to professional audio-guide practice, and says which.

Two layers, per the standard:

* **FLOOR (this module)** — deterministic, $0, runs on every tour. A BLOCKER result
  means the tour is not fit to serve and the caller regenerates.
* **GATE (elsewhere)** — semantic, model-judged. Meaning-level properties a counter
  can never see. Per ``feedback-no-lexical-shortcuts``, word-matching for MEANING is a
  banned shortcut in this project: narrative quality is judged semantically or not at
  all. This module therefore checks only STRUCTURE — counts, ratios, budgets — and
  deliberately makes no claim about whether the prose is good.

The two failures this exists to catch, both measured on the live Paris graph:

* **STARVATION** — Sainte-Chapelle (tier 5, 12 beats in corpus) rendered as 9 words.
* **GORGING** — Notre-Dame rendered 1022 words in one stop, over even the walking-tour
  adaptation of the museum sector's 250-words-per-station ceiling.

#   MEASURED  — derived from a real $0 engine run on the live Paris graph
#   INHERITED — already a constant elsewhere in the engine; not a new number
#   CITED     — professional audio-guide practice, with a URL in the standard
#   JUDGEMENT — chosen by us; the standard says so explicitly and shows the data

#: JUDGEMENT. A POI with at least this many corpus beats is "rich" — starving it is a
#: defect rather than an editorial choice. Sainte-Chapelle had 12; the thin POIs
#: around it had 3.
STARVE_MIN_BEATS: int = 5

#: JUDGEMENT, anchored on MEASURED data. Healthy stops ran ~17 and ~40 words/beat.
#: Deliberately permissive: this catches 9-words-for-12-beats (0.75), not terseness.
STARVE_MIN_WORDS_PER_BEAT: float = 12.0

#: MEASURED 2026-07-26, superseding the earlier CITED-adapted 750. Museum practice caps
#: a station at 250 words (~2 min); a walking-tour anchor with a 5-min dwell is not a
#: museum station, so the number was adapted rather than cited — but it was adapted by
#: reasoning, not measurement, and it was WRONG. Widest-stop population across the eight
#: authored tours in data/certification/tour-batch-v1/:
#:     661 / 662 / 664 / 673 / 679 / 757 / 761 / 808
#: At 750 this check BLOCKED three tours this project itself certified
#: (nyc-lower-manhattan-90, paris-marais-loop-60, paris-ile-open-90). 850 clears the
#: real ceiling (808) at 1.05x while still catching the defect it exists for — the
#: measured Notre-Dame wall of 1022-1038 words — at 1.20x.
#: Guarded by test_c8_clears_the_widest_stop_in_the_certification_corpus.
GORGE_MAX_WORDS_PER_STOP: int = 850

#: JUDGEMENT, anchored on a MEASUREMENT of the gold text. Was 15.0, CITED to Nubart /
#: Musa Guide ("keep sentences to 10-15 words for the ear"). That citation describes
#: MUSEUM STATION copy, and it does not survive contact with this project's own north
#: star: the owner's hand-written gold (standard §1) measures `mean_sentence_words`
#: **19.11** and so FAILED its own bar at 15, as did every one of 191 saved tours.
#:
#: WHAT THIS RETUNE DID AND DID NOT FIX. It moved the STOP-level pass rate from 0/38 to
#: 6/38, and it admits the gold. At TOUR level the rate barely moves — 9/9 of cohort A
#: and 176/182 of cohort B still trip C9 — because one over-long stop flags a whole tour.
#: So "a check that never passes discriminates nothing" is only half-answered here: the
#: cap is no longer unreachable, but most real tours genuinely do ramble. Do not read a
#: 100% tour-level rate in the scorer output as evidence the retune failed.
#:
#: The check itself is SOUND and was nearly deleted by mistake. C9 fires PER STOP;
#: aggregating whole-tour compresses machine figures toward the gold and hides the
#: ordering. Measured per stop across the post-audio-fix cohort: gold 19.11 against 38
#: machine stops at min 16.9 / median 23.2 / max 34.3. The gold reads shorter than 34 of
#: 38 — C9 ranks the hand-written text above machine output correctly. Only the constant
#: was wrong.
#:
#: THE RULE FOR THE NUMBER: the smallest round number strictly above the anchor. Not
#: 19.11 itself — `score_narration` rounds to 2dp, so `19.11 > 19.11` is False by nothing
#: at all, and one word added to a 509-word passage flips it. Margin is needed for a
#: second reason too: the gold's mean is taken over 27 sentences while a real stop's is
#: taken over 5-6, so the cap judges a noisier statistic than the one it was calibrated
#: on. Nothing hinges on the exact choice — 19.5 fails 33 of 38 machine stops, 20 fails
#: 32, 21 fails 31 — so the rule matters more than the value.
#: Guarded by test_c9_cap_admits_the_owners_own_gold_text — the calibration, executable.
MAX_SENTENCE_WORDS: float = 20.0

#: CITED. 130-150 words per minute of spoken narration.
WORDS_PER_MINUTE: float = 150.0

#: JUDGEMENT. No single stop should hold more than this share of the tour's words.
BALANCE_MAX_SHARE: float = 0.60

#: JUDGEMENT, from a MEASURED absurdity, and demoted to WARN by a SECOND measurement.
#: An acceptance pass on a real Île de la Cité tour found Palais de Justice and
#: Conciergerie seated as SEPARATE stops **17 metres apart** — the same building
#: complex — where the second stop opens by saying "the Conciergerie is one of the
#: few remaining vestiges of the old medieval Palais de Justice", i.e. describing the
#: spot the listener stood on seconds earlier. That is a real defect this constant
#: was written to catch.
#:
#: RECALIBRATED from 100 m to 50 m on evidence: at 100 m this also flagged
#: Sainte-Chapelle at 86 m from the Conciergerie, and that is a FALSE POSITIVE —
#: Sainte-Chapelle is a genuinely distinct attraction, and 86 m is a real (if short)
#: walk in a dense historic quarter.
#:
#: THEN, at 50 m, MEASURED across the full real corpora (2026-07-19,
#: ``tests/test_tour_selection.py::test_selection_does_not_filter_close_but_distinct_pois``):
#: Paris' 370 POIs give 48 pairs under 50 m, New York's 402 give 46. They are NOT one
#: population. True duplicates (corpus geocoding defects — the same place entered
#: twice, e.g. NYSE/Wall Street, Place/Square des Abbesses, Flatiron
#: District/Building) cluster at 0.0-1.7 m. Genuinely distinct, walkable landmarks
#: start at ~8 m: Panthéon <-> Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève (14.9 m), Place de la
#: Concorde <-> Jeu de Paume (14.3 m), Galignani <-> Angelina (11.8 m), and — the
#: decisive case — Hôtel Le Meurice <-> Angelina at **8.4 m**. Le Meurice and
#: Galignani are the two POIs the product owner's own gold text narrates as
#: consecutive stops (standard §1: "At number 224, the English bookshop
#: Galignani... Le Meurice... at 228"). No distance threshold separates "one
#: building told twice" from "two neighbours on one street" — 8.4 m (a real
#: distinction) sits well inside the 17 m defect case this constant was calibrated
#: on. A companion guard that filtered ``select_route`` on this same distance was
#: tried and REVERTED for exactly this reason (see the refutation test above,
#: [[stop-separation-guard-refuted]]); this check is demoted from BLOCKER to WARN
#: for the identical reason — refusing to SERVE a tour containing the gold-standard
#: stop is a worse defect than the one this constant was built to catch. The real
#: tool for "the same place told twice" is semantic, not geometric: G4 (repetition of
#: the same FACT anywhere in the tour, standard §4). C12 stays as a WARN surfaced to
#: the editor — a short gap is still worth a human glance — but never blocks serving.
MIN_STOP_SEPARATION_M: float = 50.0

#: JUDGEMENT. Ceiling on the C1 starvation floor, as a share of the gorge cap, so C1
#: and C8 can never demand contradictory things for a beat-rich POI. See the comment
#: at the C1 check for the Notre-Dame arithmetic that forced this.
STARVE_FLOOR_MAX_SHARE_OF_CAP: float = 0.5

#: RE-MEASURED 2026-08-06. Seconds of spoken audio required per second of WALKING.
#:
#: THE DENOMINATOR CHANGED, and that is the whole point (owner ruling, 2026-08-06).
#: This was a share of the REQUESTED duration, which asked "does this tour talk for a
#: fifth of its length?". That question only made sense while a tour's length was
#: walking plus talking. Now that a stop lasts as long as the place and the visitor
#: jointly justify, a five-hour tour can spend three and a half hours standing still —
#: and the old form demanded 57 minutes of continuous narration to approve it, which
#: refuses the persona day this whole release was built to serve. Re-measuring the old
#: fraction would have been a no-op: neither of its terms moves under the new time
#: model.
#:
#: Silence while you STAND somewhere is the product working; silence while you WALK for
#: an hour is the defect. Walking time is the denominator that asks that directly.
#:
#: RE-MEASURED on the SAME eight tracked tours the previous value was derived from
#: (``data/certification/tour-batch-v1``), by the same method, against the new
#: denominator:
#:
#:     0.738 paris-pont-neuf-notre-dame-60
#:     0.541 paris-ile-open-90
#:     0.472 nyc-village-loop-60
#:     0.451 nyc-grand-central-times-square-60
#:     0.414 paris-marais-loop-60
#:     0.387 nyc-central-park-open-90
#:     0.327 nyc-lower-manhattan-90        <- thinnest tour this project ACCEPTED
#:     ----
#:     0.059 paris-west-axis-90            <- genuinely starved: 5.0 min of audio
#:                                            across 85.3 min of walking
#:
#: The gap between the two poles is far wider under this denominator than it was
#: under the old one (5.5x, against 1.5x before), which is itself evidence that
#: walking is the quantity the check was always reaching for.
#:
#: AND ONE INTERIOR-HEAVY TOUR ADDED to the derivation set, because all eight above
#: predate visit time and a threshold calibrated on exterior-only tours alone is
#: off-distribution for what this release produces: the 300-minute Rue Royale ->
#: Notre-Dame flagship, 22.6 min of audio across 85.8 min of walking, 7 stops —
#: **0.263**, and the worst tour that must PASS.
#:
#: 0.12 is the geometric midpoint of the starved pole (0.059) and that worst
#: must-pass tour (0.263), which is 0.1246, rounded DOWN to 0.12 so the nearest
#: observed passing tour in the wider corpus (a one-stop 45-minute artifact at
#: exactly 0.125) is not decided by a coin flip. Block margin 2.03x, pass margin
#: 2.19x.
#:
#: CROSS-CHECKED against every stored tour with both numbers — 210 files under
#: ``data/*/tours``. The distribution has a real gap, not a smear: thirteen tours sit
#: at 0.018-0.054, all of them the same failing corridor (2 stops, 1.6-4.5 min of
#: audio across 76-123 min of walking), then nothing at all until 0.125. Every bar
#: between 0.055 and 0.124 blocks the identical thirteen, so this value is not
#: balanced on a knife edge.
#:
#: The previous value was 0.19 of the REQUESTED duration. It cannot be compared to
#: this one: different question, different denominator.
#:
#: It is NOT a target. Guarded from both sides by
#: test_c3_clears_the_certification_corpus_and_still_blocks_the_starved_tour.
MIN_AUDIO_FRAC_OF_WALKING: float = 0.12

#: MEASURED, 2026-07-19, over every real composed tour in ``data/*/tours/`` — 195 tour
#: files: **paris 191, london 4. ``data/new_york/tours/`` DOES NOT EXIST** and
#: contributed nothing, so this is a Paris-dominated sample (paris 485 of 501
#: stop/tour samples with a nonzero tour mean), not a three-city one. An earlier
#: revision of this comment claimed "paris, london, new_york — 487 samples"; that
#: was wrong on both counts and was caught by an adversarial re-read rather than by
#: the author. The distribution below reproduces exactly — only the stated evidence
#: base was inflated. §4 gives no absolute "dates per 100 words" ceiling for C11
#: (unlike C1/C8), so C11 flags a stop RELATIVE to
#: the tour's own mean year_density rather than an invented absolute cut. The
#: multiple is anchored on the real distribution of (stop_density / tour_mean)
#: across every measured stop: median 0.97, p90 1.67, p95 2.00, max 3.11. 3.4% of
#: samples exceed a 2.0x multiple, i.e. this sits at roughly the p95 of real
#: tours — a genuine outlier cut, not noise, without being so tight it fires on the
#: routine spread every tour has. This was a one-off measurement (not a standing
#: regression test — the corpus in ``data/*/tours/`` will drift), reproducible by
#: running ``score_narration`` per stop over every ``data/{city}/tours/*.json`` and
#: taking each stop's ``per_100w["year_density"]`` against its tour's own mean.
#: Revisit if a future corpus's distribution shifts (see standard §8's own
#: admission that external audio-guide research is "in flight").

    # CORRECTION (2026-07-19). An earlier revision of this comment justified the
    # change with a worked example — "1650s walk + 1434s audio = 3084s against a
    # 2988s ceiling", i.e. a claim that closing C3 necessarily tripped C7, BLOCKER
    # for BLOCKER. THAT ARITHMETIC WAS WRONG and is removed rather than quietly
    # corrected. The 1650s was measured on the Île de la Cité tour while an
    # unrelated selection-side experiment was applied; that experiment was reverted
    # (it moved frozen route geometry) and the figure was carried across anyway. The
    # real walk on this route is 1087s, so the sum is 2521s against 2988s — 467s of
    # HEADROOM. No such deadlock occurred on any measured tour; an adversarial
    # review caught this, not the author.
    #
    # The change rests on the PRODUCT RULING alone, which needs no arithmetic:
    # narration heard while walking is part of the tour experience and does not cost
    # the tourist extra minutes. That is a statement about what the product IS.
    #
    # The correct model has two kinds of listening:
    #   * STATIONARY — the tourist stands at a stop and listens. This ADDS to

    # pavement — so the free-airtime budget is the walk itself.
    #
    # THE MIN IS STILL HERE AND IT IS STILL LOAD-BEARING — but not for the reason
    # it used to be, and the difference matters enough to write down.
    #
    # It was a hedge between two DIFFERENT FORMULAS: this line summed the legs one
    # way and ``summarise_route`` totalled them another, and across six real Paris
    # tours they differed by -119s to +499s (ile_arch_60: 736 vs 1115). An
    # adversarial review caught the two checks silently reasoning about different
    # walks and the min was the patch. Since 2026-08-06 there is one expression —
    # ``routing.total_walk_seconds`` — so on any route ``summarise_route`` built,
    # the two sides of this min are provably equal and it is a no-op.
    #
    # It is NOT a no-op on a route somebody CONSTRUCTED: the timebox repair's
    # trials and the scoring harnesses set ``total_walk_seconds`` directly while
    # passing ``transits=()``. C7b is a BLOCKER about whether narration fits a
    # walk, so it must never overstate the airtime available, and the min is what

    # names: a stop that rendered NO Sentence at all has no key in that dict, so
    # the ``words == 0`` branch could only ever fire on a Sentence whose text was
    # literally empty. A tour routing the walker to a stop where they hear nothing
    # scored PASS and was served. C1 does not cover it either (it skips POIs with
    # fewer than STARVE_MIN_BEATS corpus beats).
    #
    # ALIGNMENT ASSUMPTION (shared with C1/C8 below, and stated here rather than
    # left implicit): ``stop_idx`` indexes ``script.selected_pois`` POSITIONALLY.

    # ``route.pois`` in order) and every Sentence's ``stop_idx`` are derived from

    # lookup BY POI ID inside that walk and may legitimately not cover every POI.

    # is skipped: it is a materialised destination with no POI of its own and is
    # content-free BY DESIGN, so silence there is not a defect.

    # A roster entry with NO SEATED PLAN (``beat_sequence.poi_beats`` has no entry
    # for it, so ``ScriptPOI.beat_ids`` is empty) is deliberately NOT skipped. It is
    # tempting to treat it as "nothing was seated, so nothing could be said", but
    # that is the WORST instance of this very defect: the tourist is still routed
    # there and still hears nothing. It also carries no false-positive risk, because
    # such a stop normally still receives its arrival/navigation glue line (attached

    # ── S1: spatial claim geometry — DELIBERATELY NOT WIRED ─────────────────
    # `src/tour/spatial_check.py` exists and is tested, but it is NOT called here.
    # It was wired on 2026-07-19 and UNWIRED the same day, on measurement.
    #
    # The hole it targets is real: SemanticFactChecker entails PROPOSITIONS against
    # source facts and never sees the directional instruction wrapped around one
    # ("look down X toward Y"), so a cue can be geometrically false and still pass
    # fact-check 0-unsupported. But the module as built emits FALSE ACCUSATIONS on
    # real shipped data. Reproduced end-to-end by an adversarial reviewer against
    # unmodified `data/new_york/poi-raw.json` with the shipped extractor:
    #
    #     "Look down Wall Street toward Trinity Church."  ->  IMPLAUSIBLE
    #
    # That cue is correct. Trinity Church stands at the head of Wall Street and is
    # its single most recognisable sightline; the check rejects it because the
    # church bears 330 deg while the street axis (derived by matching POIs whose
    # names merely END WITH "Wall Street") reads 47 deg off.
    #
    # A missed cue costs nothing. A false accusation actively degrades the tour --
    # it tells an editor a true sentence is wrong, and the standard explicitly
    # rewards concrete look-cues (G1 — C10, its lexical proxy, was deleted
    # 2026-07-27 and G1 is not built), so this check would fight the very
    # property we are trying to increase. Precision must be ~100% on real data
    # before this is wired at ANY severity, including WARN.
    #
    # Also unresolved: street-axis resolution succeeds for only 2 of 13 addressed
    # NYC candidates (one of those spurious), and `data/{city}/poi-raw.json` is not
    # shipped in the production image, so the check would degrade to all-UNKNOWN in
    # prod regardless. Fix the extractor's precision first; then re-wire as WARN.

# ── compose_fixable: is a BLOCKER worth another compose pass? ───────────────
#
# The standard's naive §7 reading — "a BLOCKER regenerates the script" — treats
# BLOCKER as one predicate. It is two: (a) may this tour be SERVED (score_tour's
# ``passed``, unchanged, never touched by anything below), and (b) is looping the
# COMPOSE step for one stop worth the money. This module answers (b). A defect
# that is upstream of compose (selection picked the wrong POI, chose a bad route,
# or the audio-seconds formula structurally cannot move) will reproduce IDENTICALLY
# on a recompose — that is spend with zero chance of convergence, and for C1 it is
# actively worse than doing nothing (an under-seated stop pushed to "write more"
# invites fabrication that the entailment gate then rejects, floors to stitch, and
# ends up terser than before). ``compose_fixable`` exists so the caller can spend
# only where a recompose can plausibly change the outcome.

    / a finding's ``severity``). A BLOCKER always means do-not-serve; this function
    answers the different question of whether looping compose for the stop is worth
    the spend. See the standard's §7 amendment for why these must not be conflated.
