"""VERIFY with teeth (§2.6, M7) — provenance + faithfulness checks.

Two INDEPENDENT checks layered on top of validation.validate_script's
traceability + forbidden-phrase gates (rapidfuzz alone is not faithfulness):

1. **Provenance** (deterministic, ``rapidfuzz``): each beat's verbatim
   ``source_passage`` must fuzzy-match the source chunk it was extracted
   from, above ``PROVENANCE_MATCH_THRESHOLD``. Catches a beat whose stored
   passage drifted from (or never existed in) its cited chunk.

2. **Faithfulness** (one entailment call per stop): every beat-cited
   sentence must follow from that beat's ``key_claims``. Pluggable
   ``FaithfulnessChecker`` — ``MockFaithfulnessChecker`` (default, offline,
   trusts the corpus) keeps ``make test`` free; ``HaikuFaithfulnessChecker``
   runs the real entailment in dev/CI/prod.

Both write to ``ValidationReport`` (the Script is never mutated). A beat
that lacks ``source_passage``/``key_claims`` is SKIPPED, not failed — the
corpus extraction pipeline backfills these; until then these checks are
no-ops and the traceability/forbidden gates still apply.
