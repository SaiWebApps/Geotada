"""THE audio placement rule — what plays where (design §5.6 C7; Phase 7 S7.3).

ONE definition of "at the stop", on the server, put on the wire. The phone SELECTS from
it (design §4.6 — "the phone holds no policy") and invents no geometry of its own: until
this module the app decided what "at the stop" meant with two literal circles of its own
(10 m to start a piece, 40 m to be "at" a place), the same for a 140 m square and a
doorway, while the corpus had carried a measured footprint per place that nothing read
(plan defect 1). The W7.2 panel ruled 11/11 that both circles die (R1).

What the rule says, per stop and per day:

- ``StopTrigger`` — the place's own FOOTPRINT: a circle sized to the place (the corpus
  ``trigger_radius``). A walker is AT the stop inside it; the piece ARMS the moment the
  footprint is first touched — the edge they arrive by, never the pin (R1 b). ``kind``
  is "circle" this phase: the corpus holds no line or polygon, so a street's line or a
  cemetery's walls are a CARRIED data row, and the field is what makes adding them an
  addition rather than a rework.
- ``PlacementPolicy`` — the day's rule for WHEN the armed piece starts: at arrival for
  every party but FAMILY, whose piece starts at the first standstill inside the footprint
  (Nadia, design §4.4.4: "a child crosses any circle twenty times"); and the radius of
  the person's OWN place — the start they set out from and the finish they named — which
  a round trip's return and the A→B sentinel take instead of a ten-metre dot (R1, Marcus
  and Sofia: "the finish within sight, never a dot by the water").

Told once is told: leaving and re-entering a footprint never replays; a tap does (R1 c,
R4). That is the phone's half of the rule, pinned by tests/test_session_seams.py.
