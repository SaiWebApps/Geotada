"""Narration quality signals — a $0, deterministic AI-tell LINT for tour narration.

WHAT THIS IS: a transparent surface-feature lint. Its trustworthy output is the
``hits`` dict — the exact stilted/AI-generated tells found, quoted, so a HUMAN can
eyeball them — plus raw per-100-word rates and sentence statistics. It flags the
measured "sounds generated" tells published craft sources name (moralizing closers,
puffery, AI-vocab, empty transitions, negative parallelism, em-dash spam, uniform
sentence rhythm) and the good-spoken-narration surface features (second-person,
sentence-initial look/move prompts, sentence-length variation).

WHAT THIS IS NOT (verified by a hostile review, 2026-07): it is NOT a quality
oracle and NOT a precise comparator. It reads only SURFACE features, so:
  - Content-free but "you"-stuffed, length-varied drivel can score well.
  - A single legitimate factual construction can dominate a short text.
So the composite ``stilted_score`` / ``engagement_score`` are COARSE: use them only
on long aggregates (a whole tour, not one beat — see ``reliable`` below) and only
for LARGE gaps. Whether Opus or ChatGPT writes a BETTER tour is decided by a human /
acceptance read of the actual narration; this lint only surfaces the tells to look
at. Never present a small score delta as evidence of a quality difference.

Sources for the tells: Rick Steves / VoiceMap / Nubart / Pathoura / Method Writing
(write for the ear; second person; short varied sentences; end on image not moral),
GPTZero (burstiness), Wikipedia "Signs of AI writing" (puffery / significance-close
/ empty transitions / negative parallelism / em-dash / AI vocab), Tilden
(provocation not instruction).
