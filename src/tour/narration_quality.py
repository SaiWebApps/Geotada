"""Narration quality signals — a $0, deterministic AI-tell LINT for tour narration.

WHAT THIS IS: a transparent surface-feature lint. Its trustworthy output is the
``hits`` dict — the exact stilted/AI-generated tells found, quoted, so a HUMAN can
eyeball them — plus raw per-100-word rates and sentence statistics. It flags the
measured "sounds generated" tells published craft sources name (moralizing closers,
puffery, AI-vocab, empty transitions, negative parallelism, em-dash spam, uniform
sentence rhythm) and the good-spoken-narration surface features (second-person,
sentence-initial look/move prompts, sentence-length variation).

WHAT THIS IS NOT (verified by a hostile review, 2026-07): it is NOT a quality
oracle and NOT a precise comparator. It reads only SURFACE features, so:
  - Content-free but "you"-stuffed, length-varied drivel can score well.
  - A single legitimate factual construction can dominate a short text.
So the composite ``stilted_score`` / ``engagement_score`` are COARSE: use them only
on long aggregates (a whole tour, not one beat — see ``reliable`` below) and only
for LARGE gaps. Whether Opus or ChatGPT writes a BETTER tour is decided by a human /
acceptance read of the actual narration; this lint only surfaces the tells to look
at. Never present a small score delta as evidence of a quality difference.

Sources for the tells: Rick Steves / VoiceMap / Nubart / Pathoura / Method Writing
(write for the ear; second person; short varied sentences; end on image not moral),
GPTZero (burstiness), Wikipedia "Signs of AI writing" (puffery / significance-close
/ empty transitions / negative parallelism / em-dash / AI vocab), Tilden
(provocation not instruction).

    G2/G3 (motivated_transition / causal_chain terms below): a LEXICAL PROXY for the
    tour-quality standard's semantic checks G2 (motivated transitions, S2) and G3
    (causal chain not list, S3) — see fixtures/tour-quality-standard/01-standard.md
    §4. This module is already an explicitly lexical/statistical heuristic (see module
    docstring). See _MOTIVATED_TRANSITION / _BARE_ADJACENCY / _CAUSAL_CHAIN above for
    the documented false-positive/false-negative shapes of this proxy.

    ⚠️ **MEASURED 2026-07-19: THE G2/G3 TERMS ARE CURRENTLY INERT IN PRODUCTION.**
    Do not cite them as a shipped quality improvement. Measured over 303 real composed
    stops from ``data/paris/tours/``, comparing this function against its pre-change
    revision:

        scores changed:        0 / 303   (0.0%)
        pairwise winner flips: 0 / 45753 (0.00%)

    The instrument was validated — an engineered probe does move (+0.2000, 3 pattern
    matches) — so this is a real result, not a broken experiment.

    WHY, and it is the useful part: the terms genuinely DO separate the owner's gold
    text (combined G2/G3 rate 0.781/100w) from machine output (0-0.186/100w). But
    ``craft_score`` is a TIE-BREAKER between TWO MACHINE CANDIDATES (see below), and
    both score ~0 on these patterns. **A metric whose discriminating power sits at the
    gold end is useless as a tie-break at the machine end.** Separating gold from
    machine and re-ranking machine-vs-machine are different jobs; only the second one
    changes what a tourist hears.

    To make these terms actually steer output, either widen the patterns until they
    register the variation that EXISTS between machine candidates (re-run the flip-rate
    measurement to confirm), or abandon the proxy and move the effort to a higher rung:
    the compose PROMPT (what gets written) or beat SELECTION (what gets seated). See
    [[founding-case-efficacy-rule]] — this change passed a gold-vs-machine validation
    and a full adversarial review while being a production no-op, because nobody
    measured the flip rate, which is the number that decides whether it does anything.

    WHERE THIS FUNCTION IS USED — it is NOT "never a gate" (a hostile review correctly
    refuted an earlier draft of this claim; corrected here):
      - compose.py:~1067 — a RANKER only: best-of-N tie-break among candidates that
        already tied on fact-safety (``_local_penalty``). Losing here means a
        differently-drafted-but-equally-fact-safe candidate ships instead; no content
        is deleted. This is craft_score's ONLY surviving caller as of Track A step A6
        (2026-07-30): the never-shipped author-engine track — including the
        ``author.py:416`` COMPARATIVE GATE this docstring used to also describe — was
        deleted at A6, and ``compose.py`` itself is scheduled for deletion at A8, after
        which this function has zero production callers.
    BOUNDING THE GATE RISK: the G2/G3 terms below are deliberately kept small relative
    to the rest of the score so they cannot flip a close comparison on their own. Each of
    motivated_rate/causal_chain_rate/bare_adjacency_rate is a per-SENTENCE fraction
    (0..1, same shape as ``look_prompt_rate``, not an unbounded per-100-words rate), and
    each is weighted at 0.2 — so the combined best-case G2+G3 swing from one sentence
    (+0.2 motivated, +0.2 causal, both firing on the same sentence) is at most 0.4,
    below the 0.5 ceiling of the smallest pre-existing bounded positive term
    (``look_prompt_rate``, weight 0.5 x max rate 1.0) and far below percussion (1.5) or
    the redundancy penalty (-1.5/pair). This bounds, but does not eliminate, the risk on
    a near-tie best-of-N comparison: a 0.2-0.4 swing from phrasing alone COULD still be
    the deciding factor — that is inherent to any composite score used to break ties, and
    is called out here rather than hidden. (The larger "remainder vs. stitch_fallback"
    hard-gate risk this section originally bounded belonged to the author-engine track's
    ``_excise``, deleted at Track A step A6 — see the caller note above; only the lower-
    stakes best-of-N ranker in compose.py remains.) See test_however_is_not_double_counted
    for the measured before/after swing.
