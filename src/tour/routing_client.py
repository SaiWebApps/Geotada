"""Valhalla pedestrian routing client with haversine fallback (M1).

Primary engine: Valhalla at ``VALHALLA_URL`` (the Render private service in
production; Docker via ``make valhalla-up`` locally, port 8002) speaking the
documented JSON API:

- POST /route      {locations: [{lat, lon}, ...], costing: "pedestrian",
                    units: "kilometers"} ->
                    trip.legs[0].summary.time (seconds),
                    trip.legs[0].summary.length (KILOMETERS),
                    trip.legs[0].shape (encoded polyline, 6-digit precision)
- POST /isochrone  {locations: [{lat, lon}], costing: "pedestrian",
                    contours: [{time: minutes}], polygons: true} ->
                    GeoJSON FeatureCollection

Every public method degrades to the pure-math fallback —
``pace_corrected_walk_seconds`` over ``haversine_m`` (src/tour/routing.py) —
when Valhalla is unreachable or answers garbage, so the engine and the test
suite work with no container running. A ``None`` polyline (route) or ``None``
result (isochrone) is the caller's signal that the fallback produced the
numbers; M2 surfaces that as ``TransitSegment.source``.

Nothing consumes this module yet — M2 wires it into ``summarise_route`` and
the contract. See specs/2026-06-12-tour-algorithm-decision/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md M1/M2.

# different people. `PACE_KMH` was 3.0 until 2026-08-06 and is now 4.5, which is
