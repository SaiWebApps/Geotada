"""Route-level claim-repetition suppression (backlog #22).

A route can seat several beats — often from DIFFERENT source books — that restate
the same historical fact. The canonical case: the Île de la Cité seats three
beats (from Around-and-About, Rough Guide, Frommer's) that each narrate "the
Parisii settled the island in the 3rd century BC", so the tourist hears the
founding story three times. The exact-beat-id dedup in ``generation.py`` cannot
catch this (different ids), and the within-POI ``_apply_b8_lite_dedup`` misses it
too (cross-book paraphrases with BC/century dates and divergent supporting-entity
casts evade its 4-digit-year + entity thresholds).

This pass runs over the ASSEMBLED sentence stream and drops a beat-sourced
sentence ONLY when EVERY ``key_claim`` that sentence realizes was already voiced
by an EARLIER, DIFFERENT beat anywhere in the route. It is deliberately surgical:

- CONTENT-SAFE by construction: a sentence that fuses a repeated fact with a
  NOVEL one (compound sentences are common — "settled c.300 BC by the Parisii,
  and in 52 BC overrun by the Romans, who built a palace-fortress") is kept
  INTACT, because it still realizes a novel claim. Only a PURE restatement — a
  sentence whose every claim is already voiced — is removed, so a distinct fact
  is never silently lost. (The trade: a compound restatement may voice a
  duplicated fact a second time; that is accepted to guarantee zero content loss.
  A beat that ALSO carries distinct claims keeps every sentence carrying one.)
- It NEVER empties a beat: at least one sentence per beat always survives, so the
  set of emitted beat-ids is unchanged and the golden overlap gate is not
  perturbed (it counts distinct beat source-ids, not sentences).
- It only touches ``source_type == "beat"`` sentences; glue, synthesized openers
  and reflections are never removed.

Reported-audio honesty (#8): ``_sum_audio`` now scales each cited beat by its
SURVIVING-sentence fraction, so a trimmed beat reports only what it voiced (a
non-deduped beat keeps all sentences -> no change). ``verify._visited_claims``
keys off the whole beat's ``key_claims``, but that is NOT a dedup leftover: this
pass always keeps the FIRST occurrence of a claim, so any claim a later
reflection cites was voiced at least once — the pre-existing key_claims-vs-voiced
mismatch is independent of dedup. (Residual: ``_flatten_pois`` per-stop
``dwell_seconds`` still measures the pre-dedup plan — a small per-stop display
over-report on the rare deduped stop; the tour TOTAL is honest.)

Detection is deterministic (no build-time LLM): each sentence is matched to the
beat's best key_claim; two claims are "the same fact" when their canonical-token
signatures have high overlap. Dates are canonicalized to centuries so
"300 BC" and "the 3rd century BC" unify.
