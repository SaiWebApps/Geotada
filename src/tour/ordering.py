"""ORDER — visiting order for the selected anchor set (M4).

The greedy's insertion order is a by-product of selection, not an optimum;
§3.2's ORDER step makes it exact. ``order_stops`` is the entry point every
caller uses: it orders EXACTLY (Held-Karp) while that is tractable, and by
cheapest insertion above it. No OR-Tools (the design forbids the dependency).

Costs come from the same LegSecondsFn divisor selection uses (routed when
Valhalla is up, pace-corrected haversine otherwise) and may be asymmetric —
the DP is directed throughout.
