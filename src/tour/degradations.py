"""Everything that silently made a tour worse, collected so a human can SEE it.

WHY THIS EXISTS (owner ruling 2026-07-31). ``HaikuGlueClient`` was made to fail
soft — a provider hiccup on one transition sentence falls back to a template
instead of destroying the whole tour. The first version only wrote a log line,
and the owner's answer was immediate and correct: *"Don't just log errors.
Actually show them in the workbench UI. Otherwise, they're invisible."*

He is right, and the project has the scars. A degrade nobody sees is
indistinguishable from success — that is exactly how canned transitions shipped
as the default for months, how a silent WAV passed for narration, and how a
validation report read "clean" having verified nothing. Logging moves the lie
from the product into a file nobody opens.

So: whatever degrades, RECORD it here, and the API hands it to the page.

THE TWO AUDIENCES, both required by the ruling:

1. **A human** reads ``human`` and knows what they lost, in plain words, with no
   identifiers: "The walking directions between stops were written from a
   template, not by the narrator."
2. **Claude** reads ``detail`` and can act without a conversation: the exception
   type, the message, the component and the operation. The page pastes the whole
   thing as one block.

Request-scoped via ``contextvars`` so a threaded compose fan-out cannot leak one
request's degradations into another's response.

    An earlier version of this module's docstring asserted "safe to call from
    anywhere, including threads". It was false, in the one module written to stop
    invisible failures. Copying the caller's context carries the scope across, so
    the two compose fan-outs (``premium_tour.execute_premium_plan`` and
    ``authoring``) can report what went wrong inside them.

    ONE ENTERABLE CONTEXT PER CALL, and the ``.copy()`` is the whole point. Both
    fan-outs wrap ONCE and hand the single returned closure to a thread pool, so
    several workers run ``_run`` at the same instant. A ``Context`` object cannot
    be entered by two threads at once — running the wrap-time snapshot directly
    raised ``RuntimeError: cannot enter context: ... is already entered`` on every
    tour with two or more stops, for three days, because real units are slow
    provider calls and the overlap is guaranteed rather than probabilistic.

    The snapshot must still be taken HERE, at wrap time, on the caller's thread:
    that is what carries the caller's collection scope. Calling
    ``contextvars.copy_context()`` inside ``_run`` instead would copy the WORKER's
    empty context and silently drop every degradation — the same invisibility,
    wearing a fix's clothes.
