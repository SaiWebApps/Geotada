"""GRADE — exemplar-calibrated tour rubric (§2.7, M8).

A pure, weighted multi-axis score of a generated tour against a golden
fixture. This is a CI REGRESSION gate, not the ≥90% golden-overlap ideal:
the baseline is set so the current corpus passes with margin and a genuine
regression (POIs lost, spine wrong, beats dropped, validation broken) drops
below it. Never self-tunes — changing a weight or the baseline is a
deliberate, reviewed edit (§2.7).

The scoring function is pure (no DB, no engine) so it is unit-tested in the
default bar; the live grading harness (``tests/test_tour_grade.py``, marked
``grade``) runs the real pipeline against the dev graph and grades it.
