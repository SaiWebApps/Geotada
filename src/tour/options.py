"""RouteOption assembly — the §2.8 output contract, one per flavour (M6).

Pure functions over engine outputs (Route + Script + the snapshot's beat
refs). The API layer wraps these into responses; M7 fills stop_audio and
the grounded why_this_works.

Phase 3 Step 3.4: populate the spotlight model on the output. Each stop
carries its computed ``spotlight`` score (s3.1) and its collapsed output
``band`` ("dwell" vs "vignette"); the option carries a per-corridor
``lens_coverage_note`` (s3.1) when lenses were requested. This is ANNOTATION
ONLY -- which stops are selected and their ORDER are decided upstream in
select_route by the existing gates, so the Step-2.0d identity baseline is
untouched. Selected (on-corridor) stops score at proximity 1.0 (detour 0),
so spotlight == gravity x lens_relevance, always strictly positive.

    THE ONE FORMULA. Generate has to know a flavour's elapsed time BEFORE it can build

    has been saved), so the number is computed here and used by both. Restating the sum
    at the second call site is exactly how the saved tour and the offered tour drift
    into declaring different lengths for the same walk.

    A walk-past sight or a line heard on the move costs no elapsed time — it happens

    The walking half is ``routing.total_walk_seconds``, the same expression the Route
    was built with. This line used to spell it differently — branching on whether
    ``leg_seconds`` was set rather than on whether Valhalla produced it — and the two
    agreed only because the fallback path happens to compute the same number. A leg
    with a routed duration but a haversine provenance would have made the served
    clock and the planned clock disagree, silently.

    THE ONE INTERLEAVE. This absorbed the fourth copy, the private preview builder
    that lived in the API layer (``src/api/routes/trips.py``, deleted 2026-08-04):
    the preview and the flavour cards were two implementations of the same ordering,
    and they had already drifted — the preview split walk-concurrent narration onto
    its own card and the option builder did not, so the workbench and the phone
    disagreed about what a "stop" is.

    THREE KINDS OF CARD, in walking order:
      leg      — what the tourist hears WHILE WALKING into the next dwell stop. Emitted
                 only when the walk actually carries narration; an empty card would
                 imply content that does not exist. ``minutes`` is the WALK.
      vignette — a walk-past one-liner on that leg, voiced through the SAME helper the
                 audio path uses, so the printed line and the spoken line cannot drift.
                 A vignette POI with no voiceable beat is not shown, because it is not
                 heard either.
      dwell    — the stop itself, with the stationary narration and the deeper-dive flag.

    ``sequence`` is required and has no default on purpose: an optional narration
    source is exactly how a caller silently gets a card list with no narration and
    nobody notices.

    eta_seconds is unchanged and still counts routed legs (or the pace-corrected
    haversine) plus every dwell: a vignette or leg card costs no elapsed time.

    Step 3.4 (s3.1/s7): each stop is annotated with its ``spotlight`` score and
    collapsed output ``band``, and the option carries a per-corridor
    ``lens_coverage_note``. ANNOTATION ONLY -- the stop set and order come from
    select_route's gates upstream; this only describes them. ``snapshot``
    supplies each POI's tier (gravity) and beat lenses (lens_relevance);
    ``script.inputs.lenses`` is the requested genre. Selected stops are
    on-corridor, so proximity is the on-path default (detour 0 -> 1.0) and
    spotlight == gravity x lens_relevance, which is strictly positive.

    Track B (Step B.3): ``route.vignettes`` (leg_idx -> walk-past POIs, leg i
    = the walk INTO stop i) are interleaved as ``band="vignette"`` stops right
    after their leg-origin stop — the vignette on leg i sits between stop i-1
    and stop i (a leg-0 vignette would precede stop 0; a round trip's closing
    leg, index len(stops), would follow the last stop). Dwell stops, their
    order, and eta_seconds are unchanged: a vignette is a walk-past one-liner
    (minutes=0), not a stop with dwell time.
