"""Within-POI beat ordering — §3.3 of phase-1-design.

Given a POI and its active beats, pick an ordering strategy and emit a
deterministic ordered list.

Phase 7.5 (2026-04-29) tightened the Area cold-open hoist
(`find_area_orientation_beat`): a sibling-POI orientation beat may only
hoist when (a) it is the start POI's own beat, (b) the beat carries no
physical_cues at all, or (c) the beat's source POI is within
`HOIST_PROXIMITY_M` of the start stop. Otherwise the cues describe a
different physical location and would land geographically dishonest at
the cold-open. Falls through to SYNTHESIZED_OPENER instead.

- "sub_location": building walk. Use fixtures.SUB_LOCATION_ORDER if
  curated; otherwise fall back to the (alphabetically stable) order of
  distinct sub_locations seen on the beats. Pick at most one beat per
  sub_location bucket. The trailing "no sub_location" pool then emits
  best-first (R1) — not a single closer.
- "trigger_address": square circumnavigation. Stable order by trigger
  address; one beat per address, then the no-address pool best-first (R1).

Every strategy's plan is then trimmed to a per-tier ceiling (DEFAULT_FLAT_MAX
for dense stops) centrally in select_poi_beats — the golden's human-ideal roster
never voices more than that at a single stop.
- "narrative_function": flat fallback. hook → establishing → deepen →
  climax -> callback (and any remaining), 4-6 beats.

Branch thresholds match phase-1-design.md: sub_location active when
≥3 distinct values populated on tier-5/4 anchors; trigger_address active
when ≥5 distinct values; otherwise flat.

Pure functions. No Neo4j. The Neo4j loader lives in selection.py.

    Constructive interleave: bucket the beats into somber/reverent vs.
    relief (everything else), preserving each bucket's stable input order.
    Emit at most two consecutive somber beats before forcing a relief beat
    whenever any relief remains; only when relief is exhausted do we fall
    back to the honest (still-somber) tail. This provably contains no run of
    three consecutive somber/reverent beats whenever relief beats exist to
    break every run — unlike a local-swap heuristic, it cannot ping-pong
    between a leading and a trailing run.

    ``group_of`` (2026-07-19) confines the interleave to one contiguous spatial
    group at a time. A sub_location / trigger_address plan is sequenced address
    by address, and the whole-stop interleave reordered beats ACROSS those
    groups: at the Conciergerie it emitted sub-anchor ``rue-de-paris-cells``
    twice, non-contiguously, split by marie-antoinette-cell and
    kitchen-pavilion — walking the listener away from a spot and back to it.
    Note ``_order_body_chronologically`` is already guarded to the flat strategy
    for exactly this reason; tone-variety was not.

    Tradeoff, deliberate: a wholly-somber group can still run past two, and a
    run may join across a group boundary. For a spatially-sequenced stop, walk
    coherence outranks rule 19 — the alternative is teleporting the listener.
