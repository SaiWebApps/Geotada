"""Tour-builder routing math.

Constants and pure functions used by selection.py:

- haversine: great-circle distance in metres between (lat, lng) points.
- pace_corrected_walk_seconds: applies the x1.35 Paris haversine correction
  on top of the 3 km/h walking pace.
- envelope_radius_m: the radius around `start` reachable inside the
  err-short walk budget.
- insertion_cost_seconds: best-insertion marginal cost used by the greedy
  selection step (§3.2 marginal_route_cost). Final ordering is exact —
  see src/tour/ordering.py (M4 Held-Karp).
- summarise_route: rolls up an ordered POI list into a Route shell with
  transit segments, walk distance, and walk-time totals.

Constants are exported as module-level so tests can pin them and so
selection.py reads identical values.

    Selection already scores with routed leg seconds when a routing client is

    ``costing_options_override`` (plan S2.7) carries the route-surface axis's
    Valhalla costing to every leg this route contains, so the shipped route's
    times and shapes are the SAME step-avoiding request selection priced —
    never a route selected under one costing and reported under another.
    ``None`` (the default) is today's request, byte-identical.

    The six keyword extras exist so a caller REBUILDING a route it has already
    decided on can hand back the parts this function cannot recompute — the
    walk-past sights, the thin-area disclosure, which stops were the marquee ones,
    how long this visitor spends at each, and how far short of the request the
    tour honestly runs. Their defaults are exactly what an ordinary caller got
    before they existed, so nothing changes for anyone who omits them.

    Building the route right ONCE is the point. The alternative, which this
    replaces, was to build it wrong and then patch each piece back on afterwards
    with a copy-and-update per piece — four chances for the rebuilt tour to
    quietly stop being the tour the traveller chose.

    ``planned_visit_seconds`` is the one that cannot be recomputed at all: it is
    priced against a CorpusSnapshot and this function has none. A rebuild that
    omits it silently collapses every stop to the length of its own narration.
    ``planned_queue_seconds`` (Phase 7 S7.5, the seventh extra) is priced at the
    same one site in selection — the seconds of line at each stop's arrival hour
    — and rides the same way: the audio placement rule reads it to decide which
    stop's piece waits for the line, so a rebuild that omits it silently unqueues
    every stop. Empty is the identity every other caller gets. ``visit_goes_inside``
    and ``planned_outside_seconds`` (S7.6, the eighth and ninth) are the door and
    the seconds before it, from the same site — a rebuild without them has no
    door anywhere, and a marquee's piece runs on under the roof.
