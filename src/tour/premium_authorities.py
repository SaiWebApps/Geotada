"""Packaged hashes for the frozen Premium authoring authorities.

The two manifests these last two hashes are taken from live under
``fixtures/tour-certification/``. Both moved out of a ``specs/`` tree that was
deleted 2026-09-02 by owner ruling; this docstring named that tree until the
same day.

The reference manifest lists 28 documents. Only the THREE that the CALIBRATION
manifest's ``anchors`` point at are ever opened, and those three live under
``fixtures/certification-references/``. (The reference manifest separately
classifies four entries as ``calibration_anchor``; that field is not what the
loader reads.) The other 25 resolve to nothing: 11 were already dead before
2026-09-02, and 14 were deleted that day along with the tree they sat in. The
manifest is a sealed provenance record, not a promise that every file it names
still exists, and saying otherwise here would be a claim this file cannot keep.

Runtime code imports only the pins below, so a manifest that moves does not
change what runs — but a pin that no longer matches its manifest would go
unnoticed, because the test that held the two together was retired 2026-08-18
with the other frozen-artefact pins.
