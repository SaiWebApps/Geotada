"""Reflection placement — spec §6 (Phase 4 Step 4.1).

A reflection is a short synthesis of what has ALREADY been visited, spoken
during a long walking leg to fill the audio deficit. This module owns only
the deterministic PLACEMENT — which legs get one. The reflection TEXT is
composed at COMPOSE time (an LLM synthesis over the visited beats'
key_claims — a template cannot write it) and is gated fail-closed by VERIFY.

Placement rule (locked from the spec's deferred clarifications):

- The leg INTO stop ``k`` (``k >= 1``) is eligible iff its walking time
  exceeds the audio the leg already carries by at least
  ``REFLECTION_MIN_DEFICIT_SECONDS``. Leg audio = the directional corpus
  transit beat ``_build_transit`` would pick when one exists, else the flat
  ~4s glue line (mirrors ``generation._sum_audio``).
- Slot 0 never fires — nothing has been visited yet.
- Longest deficits win; never two consecutive legs; cap = max(1, stops // 2).
