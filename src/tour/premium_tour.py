    the bare walk to its finish (one leg home, W5.2 R1.1): the end sentinel is
    its one stop, so the structural refusal below still sees a route with a stop.

    Phase 4 (design §8.1) deleted pick-one-of-three: no persona ever wanted to

    the dials on the request are how a person changes it. ``choose_discrete_route``

    already excluded from the dwell pool the raise is a can't-happen guard, kept
