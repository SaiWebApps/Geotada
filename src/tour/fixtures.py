"""Named ordering tables for tier-5 anchors with hand-curated walks.

Each entry maps a POI's `name` (city-scoped) to an ordered list of
sub_location slugs as they appear in the empirical walk-throughs. The
order encodes the spatial walk path through the building or square.

Beat ordering for these POIs uses these tables when sub_location is
populated. Beats whose `sub_location` is missing from the table sort
last, in stable name order.

Adding a new POI: follow the empirical-tour walk path. Don't infer
ordering from corpus-cluster heuristics — get it from a hand-write or
the source guidebook.
