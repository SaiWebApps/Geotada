"""TTS provider protocol and implementations.

All providers implement the TTSProvider protocol. Real providers use httpx
for HTTP calls (no SDK dependencies required).

Usage:
    provider = get_provider("openai")   # or "elevenlabs"
    audio_bytes = provider.generate("Hello, welcome to Paris.")

OWNER RULING, 2026-07-31 — NO FAKE PROVIDER IS EVER SERVED
----------------------------------------------------------
``MockTTSProvider`` returns a silent WAV. It exists so the test suite can drive
the whole audio pipeline for $0. It is therefore DEFINED here but deliberately
NOT REGISTERED: ``_PROVIDERS`` holds only implementations that GENUINELY
SYNTHESIZE SPEECH.

That single fact is what makes the workbench honest. The editorial workbench
builds its provider dropdown from ``GET /audio/providers`` -> ``list_providers()``
(``frontend/review.html``'s ``loadTtsProviders`` wipes the static markup and
repopulates it), so anything in this registry is one click away from a human who
is trying to judge what a TOURIST will hear. A silent WAV offered there is the
exact lie the never-mock-in-the-workbench rule exists to prevent — and hiding it
in the page instead of here would leave ``POST /audio/preview {"provider":
"mock"}`` answering with canned bytes anyway.

The ONLY way a fake becomes resolvable is ``register_provider()``, called
in-process. ``tests/conftest.py`` is its one caller, so the fake is present in a
pytest interpreter and absent from every uvicorn one (the workbench server, the
Playwright test server, and Render). No environment variable, no request body and
no config layer can put it back.

    WHY NOT ``tts-1-hd`` (measured 2026-08-28, and this is a BUG FIX)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    The owner reported intermittent 500s — "The server had an error while
    processing your request. Sorry about that!" — and it looked like an OpenAI
    outage. It was not. The trigger is the SCRIPT, not the server, and it is
    reproducible on demand: against a live key, in one minute, ``tts-1-hd``
    answered 500 on three of four attempts at this repo's own Café de Flore
    Occupation beat (``src/seed/narratives.py``) and 500 on each of that beat's
    sentences alone, while the Eiffel Tower beat voiced fine on the same key and
    network. Ordinary WWII history for a Paris walk — the Occupation, the Nazis,
    the resistance — and the model reports a SERVER error rather than saying it
    will not read it, which is exactly why it read as an outage.

    ``_post_with_retry`` can never fix that: it is not a blip, it is the same
    wall three times. ``gpt-4o-mini-tts`` voiced the identical paragraph 3/3.

    So the default is the 2025 model, which is also the cheaper one ($12 vs $30
    per million characters) and carries an ``instructions`` field for directing
    the narrator's tone — deliberately NOT used yet: how this narrator should
    sound is a writing decision, not a default to slip in here.

    A vendor that will not speak is ours to survive, whatever the reason. The

    not one: ``tts-1-hd`` answered 500 on a PARTICULAR script three times out of
    four while another script voiced fine on the same key in the same minute (see
    ``OpenAITTSProvider``). That instance is fixed by the model default; the class

    three attempts over ~1.5 seconds cannot help when all three hit one wall —

    Whole-text, never mid-text. A fallback re-voices the ENTIRE narration from
    the start, because a stop that switches narrator mid-paragraph is worse than
    one voiced by the understudy throughout. Only ``TTSError`` moves us down the
    chain — a bad request or an empty script fails everywhere and must surface.

    ``voice_id`` is deliberately passed to the PRIMARY ALONE. A voice name
    belongs to one vendor ("nova" is OpenAI's; ElevenLabs wants its own id), so
    forwarding it would ask the understudy for a voice it has never heard of.
    Each fallback uses its own configured default instead.
