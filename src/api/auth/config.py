# reads os.environ, a snapshot taken at process start, so a value Render injects
# into the container AFTER this process started is NOT visible to an in-process
# re-read — the proven recovery there was a FRESH process (container restart).

# weaken the fail-closed guard below, costs nothing on every healthy path, and —
