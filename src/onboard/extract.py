"""LIVE English-Wikipedia extract fetching for onboarding beats.

In a LIVE onboarding run each assembled POI's beats must be grounded against that
POI's CURRENT Wikipedia revision — not a stale committed fixture (which is what
``flow.build_extracts`` reads in the default fixture mode, and which would ground
a live city's beats against fake revisions while leaving most POIs with no beats
at all). This module is the live path.

Two public surfaces:

- ``resolve_and_fetch_extract(poi)`` — resolve ONE POI's en.wikipedia article
  (from its discovery ``source_urls``, an explicit wiki title/tag, or a name
  search), verify the article's own coordinates sit near the POI (so a
  name-ambiguous title never grounds the wrong place), then fetch + pin the
  current revision's plain-text lead extract. Returns ``None`` — never a junk
  ``WikiExtract`` — for a missing page, a disambiguation page, or an empty extract.
- ``build_live_extracts(pois)`` — map that over the final POI list and return
  ``(extracts, report)`` where ``report`` accounts for EVERY POI: how many
  resolved, which names missed, which were skipped (empty slug), and the coverage
  percentage, so ``flow`` can surface thinness LOUDLY (no silent under-grounding).

Every network hop goes through ``fetch.http_get_json`` — the ingest allowlist door
(``en.wikipedia.org`` is allowlisted, the descriptive User-Agent is already set).
This module NEVER shells out to ``scripts/wiki_fetch.py`` (that writes with the
platform text encoding and hardcodes the ``data/`` path); it reuses only the
MediaWiki query SHAPE.
