"""Project Gutenberg (public-domain books) — Step-3 source connector.

Gutenberg is the license-clean full-text well: every book Project Gutenberg
distributes is public domain, and gutendex (the JSON API in front of it) tags
each result with a ``copyright`` flag. This connector GATES on ``copyright is
False`` — a book whose ``copyright`` is ``True`` (still in copyright), missing,
or ``None`` is EXCLUDED — so nothing that isn't demonstrably public domain can
enter the pipeline as an ingestable ``SourceDocument``.

PURE, like every Step-3 connector: ``consult_url`` names the gutendex query and
``parse`` maps the JSON payload to a typed ``ConnectorResult`` — neither touches
the network or filesystem, and this module never imports ``src.onboard.fetch``.

The real full-text DOWNLOAD is deferred to Step 8; here the gutendex payload
carries a short ``excerpt`` per book which stands in as the document ``text`` so
the emitted ``SourceDocument`` is complete.
