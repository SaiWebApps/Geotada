"""INTERNET_ARCHIVE Step-3 connector — with the F6 per-item public-domain wall.

archive.org is allowlisted BY HOST (grey-zone wall 2), but the SAME host also
serves in-copyright Controlled-Digital-Lending scans. Being reachable through
the allowlist door therefore does NOT prove an item is public-domain. This
connector closes that gap: ``_is_public_domain`` verifies per-item PD status and
``parse`` emits a ``SourceDocument`` ONLY for items that pass — anything not
provably PD emits NOTHING. That refusal (asserted by the F6 zero-documents test)
is a committed legal wall.

CONSERVATIVE CONTRACT (fail-closed, ONE authoritative signal). This wall keyed
on the ``licenseurl`` acceptance path THREE times and it broke THREE times — a
substring bug, then a host-spoof, then an OR-override where a genuine-host PD
``licenseurl`` overrode an explicit ``possible-copyright-status: IN_COPYRIGHT``.
So auto-ingest now keys SOLELY on IA's own computed
``possible-copyright-status`` being EXACTLY ``NOT_IN_COPYRIGHT``. There is no
``licenseurl`` path and no free-text ``rights`` path: neither grants acceptance
under any circumstance. A genuinely public-domain item that LACKS that computed
status is intentionally NOT auto-ingested here — reach for the Manual book-drop
instead. This is deliberately fail-closed: it is a copyright wall, and refusing
a real PD item is cheap while ingesting one in-copyright scan is not.

PURE, like every Step-3 connector: ``consult_url`` names the advancedsearch URL
+ params, ``parse`` maps the raw JSON to a typed result. Neither touches the
network or the filesystem, and this module does NOT import ``src.onboard.fetch``
— the single fetch happens in ``base.run_connector``. Live full-text download is
deferred to Step 8; the fixture/search response supplies an ``excerpt``.
