"""Step-3 SHADOW-DISCOVERY connector — the grey-zone discovery-ONLY path.

This connector surfaces shadow-library (Anna's Archive / WeLib) search hits as
metadata-only ``DiscoveryPointer``s, so a human can acquire the work LEGALLY and
feed it through the Manual book-drop flow. It NEVER fetches text: ``consult_url``
returns a HUMAN search-page link that is only ever surfaced as an outbound link
(never GET-ed — the shadow hosts are not on the ingest allowlist), and ``parse``
maps an already-provided metadata payload to pointers.

F8 (connector isolation) — this module imports ONLY ``src.onboard.models``. It
does NOT import ``src.onboard.fetch`` (the network door), ``src.onboard.sources
.base`` (``run_connector``, the ONE thing that fetches), or any HTTP client
(``httpx`` / ``requests`` / ``urllib.request``). With no network-capable import
there is no code path here that can fetch, so discovery can only ever surface
metadata pointers. Enforced structurally by
``test_shadow_discovery_never_imports_the_fetcher`` (an AST import check) in
tests/test_onboard_boundary.py.
