"""In-memory job store for onboarding runs.

The store is PROCESS-LOCAL: it lives in a module-level singleton and dies with
the process. That is intentional and sufficient for the local single-user
workbench (the API and the CLI share one store per process via ``get_store()``).
There is no persistence — a restart drops all jobs, and that is fine because an
onboarding run is a short live session the user watches to completion.

All mutation goes through a ``threading.Lock`` so the SSE streamer, the snapshot
poller, and the background onboarding worker can touch one job concurrently
without racing the ``seq`` counter or the ``events`` list.
