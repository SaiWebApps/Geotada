"""The ONLY ingest HTTP door (grey-zone wall 2).

Every Step-3 source connector calls ``assert_ingestable(url)`` BEFORE any
network I/O. Only registrable domains that are license-clean / public-domain
are allowed; a shadow library (Anna's Archive / WeLib) or any non-allowlisted
host raises ``IngestDomainError``. Shadow libraries are DISCOVERY-ONLY: their
metadata is surfaced as ``DiscoveryPointer`` for the human to acquire legally,
and their text is NEVER fetched or ingested here.

The client itself is deliberately tiny — the value of this module is the guard,
not a feature-rich HTTP layer. It defaults to ``fixture`` mode so the test bar
NEVER touches the network; ``live`` mode (real ``httpx``) is opt-in via
``ONDOWAY_ONBOARD_HTTP=live`` and only exercised in Step 8.
